	abstract="Recently, a small number of papers have appeared in which the authors implement stochastic search algorithms, such as evolutionary computation, to generate game content, such as levels, rules and weapons. We propose a taxonomy of such approaches, centring on what sort of content is generated, how the content is represented, and how the quality of the content is evaluated. The relation between search-based and other types of procedural content generation is described, as are some of the main research challenges in this new field. The paper ends with some successful examples of this approach.",
