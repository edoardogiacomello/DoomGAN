Continue in this cold and hostile world in your mission to hold back the invasion of the aliens. Singlehanded you must fight your way through this brick and rock style world. How hard can it be??  However you were told that these aliens showed no sign of intteligence and UAC headquarters believed that it was an easy job for you to hold back these \"neanderthal beings\". Your first mission proved that! They believed that they had no techological knowledge. However now you start to suspect that they may have some technological know-how afterall. Small tech devices are now appearing in this alien world and things seem less random and messy this time. Are you getting closer to a truth well hidden by the UAC? Or are you simply starting to get paranoia? Suddenly you don\u00b4t feel so confident in your victory afterall. Maybe there was a meaning as to why your first infiltration were so succesfull? As you hide in their bloody sewers, you are getting other thoughts. Your self-esteem are dropping rapidly as you look at the shotgun in front of you. Now you have another mission to fullfill!  Well, I must admit, that I somewhere late in the process of this level, made some mistakes regarding this level. These have resulted in multiple changes and corrections in the making of the leveldesign which made some things differ a lot from my first ideas about it. It forced me to make some changes which resulted in a totally different outcome of the level structure and gameplay. So therefore, the level will never in my eyes reach the same quality as Flay the Obscene. Had these \"things\" never occured in the first place in the making of the level, and were I not forced to have corrected them negatively, well, then I guess the finished product would have been somewhat execellent.

Also, be cool with the ammo or you may find yourself with only bullets and a chainsaw to kill the TWO cyberdemons in the final arena! Try to save your plasma until you really need it, like whenever you find a Cyberdemon. A SUGGESTION: Don't go to the 'slime room' until you've finished the 'yellow key' section. Good luck... \r\nI welcome your feedback..wads can always get better...If you played \"Bruiser\" or it's twin \"Bruised\" and beat it, you may be ready for the 'turbo' version of that wad...It's lots tougher, with numerous monster and ammo 'upgrades', and very do-able for good players.

You had singlehanded cleared earth of every scum-blood-dirt sucking alien bastard ever to hit the face of the univers. Or so you thought. As you had probably realised as you were fighting your way through halls, corri- dors and entire cities of hell and horror these alien reptiles had a rather advan- ced technology. And so years before we were ever going to invent time travel they had all ready done it. The few places you did not strike them they used their short time in making time travel experiments. And now they want your head on a stick for being too damn superior. Blasting three rockets into the superbrain almost took your last efforts, but still you had the strenght to drag yourself to a teleporter, adjust your wrist communica- tor to the exact coordinates of the UAC headquarters, or what was left of it, and beam home. Meanwhile those alien arschlocks were con- ducting experiments with their timemachine in order to trap you and beam you back in time to their planet. Right into a play- field of horror and death and humiliation. You would never stand a chance and they would all laugh and spit on you as you would fall to the ground dead! But their machine caught it wrong and send you outside the playfield and into the middle of their smelly bloodinfested world of hate. Here is the chance to prevent all the horror. Kill them now or earth will be for ever doomed.

Nevertheless this level gives great fun in multiplayer mode. Deathmatch is possible, of course, but this level might be a little too big for this. Recommendation for rookies: Take skill 1!

And so years before we were ever going to invent time travel they had all ready done it. The few places you did not strike them they used their short time in making time travel experiments. And now they want your head on a stick for being too damn superior. Blasting three rockets into the superbrain almost took your last efforts, but still you had the strenght to drag yourself to a teleporter, adjust your wrist communica- tor to the exact coordinates of the UAC headquarters, or what was left of it, and beam home. Meanwhile those alien arschlocks were con- ducting experiments with their timemachine in order to trap you and beam you back in time to their planet. Right into a play- field of horror and death and humiliation. You would never stand a chance and they would all laugh and spit on you as you would fall to the ground dead! But their machine caught it wrong and send you outside the playfield and into the middle of their smelly bloodinfested world of hate. Here is the chance to prevent all the horror.
