The idea with this map was that it would be fast to make the surroundings so that I could use more time to design the gameplay. The design is \"effective\" in that it doesn't contain perverse amount of linedefs. It is stuff that looks good but still is fast to draw. Keep It Simple Stupid, like. The reason for this is the most recent thing I made (nightwing) that took like 6 months to complete but still turned out to be crap. It had awesome architecture, but the gameplay was lacking.

As you had probably realised as you were fighting your way through halls, corri- dors and entire cities of hell and horror these alien reptiles had a rather advan- ced technology. And so years before we were ever going to invent time travel they had all ready done it. The few places you did not strike them they used their short time in making time travel experiments. And now they want your head on a stick for being too damn superior. Blasting three rockets into the superbrain almost took your last efforts, but still you had the strenght to drag yourself to a teleporter, adjust your wrist communica- tor to the exact coordinates of the UAC headquarters, or what was left of it, and beam home. Meanwhile those alien arschlocks were con- ducting experiments with their timemachine in order to trap you and beam you back in time to their planet. Right into a play- field of horror and death and humiliation. You would never stand a chance and they would all laugh and spit on you as you would fall to the ground dead! But their machine caught it wrong and send you outside the playfield and into the middle of their smelly bloodinfested world of hate. Here is the chance to prevent all the horror. Kill them now or earth will be for ever doomed. Blast your way through terror and traps in this gothic like adventure mixed with hells most horific creatures, state-of-the-art guns and not to mention, you!

You can do it manually, (See Example command line at bottom) Play it however you want to but this wad is intended to be played Ultra Violence , Fast Monsters. You probably will need to learn it on lower vio. levels with slow Monsters before Uv & Fast are possible to do. There is a demo included ( single player , fast, Uv , Standard Guns) Demo note: Doom2 ver. 1.9 only There are large amounts of plasma & rocket ammo for the benefit of those with out a weapons patch.  Remember its nightime so don't crank the gamma levels (brightness) levels too far . When looking out into the garden from the entry room windows you should see areas which are flickering from the torch light and the floor of the raised area (with the trees) should look like a green pool table top would appear in torch light. Enjoy ,JB DOOMJESUS sez:  \" Just play the game with a ( REALISTIC ) guns patch ,like the superb \" ROSSGUNS \".  Use ultra violence,fast monsters , and don't die or cheat. If you can do these things, even though you have no friends you can still be considered cool and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that you really are better than someone at something and you have my blessing.

On to more important info: DO NOT ERASE THE REJECT MAP FOR THIS LEVEL! If you don't know what I mean, then you probably don't have to worry about it. You can erase the reject block map of a wad file by looking at it with almost any wad editor then saving the file. You can also erase the reject map by rebuilding the wad with some node builders.  MAP 15 There is a second exit switch to the secret level. Try and find it! There are many jumps across canyons. Some of these jumps are difficult. Don't get discouraged. I didn't intend for there to be any secret to these jumps, I just meant for them to be difficult. I obviously put some of the better goodies on the higher levels, so if you are playing this level in deathmatch, DON'T GIVE UP YOUR HIGH GROUND! This level was obviously designed with deathmatch in mind. There are LOTS of ambush and scouting spots available, especially if you make it to higher ground. This level also plays remarkably well in single-player and cooperative modes. There are a couple of \"special effects\" in this level. I put a couple of \"two-way\" mirrors in here. Beasties can only see through them if they are on the \"two-way\" side. You won't be able to see the beasties. If, however, you manage to get behind the \"two-way\" side, you can shoot at beasties without fear.

Hansen aka Dykanden", "description": "/story After saving the Earth from Hell\u00b4s most gruesome spawn, you suddenly found yourself in the unpleasent situation of being the center of the universe, and was very fast overrun by eager and irritating journalists from all over the world. Being famous was not really your wildest dream. The psychological presure got too high -even higher than being blasted 20 feet across a room by an incoming rocket- and you needed to escape; escape the boring and stressing real world. You asked the remaining management of the UAC to find you a hard job among ordinary people, who had not really had much contact to the outside world through the last few years, so that you could put your past behind you and occupy yourself with something totally different than blasting monster limbs through a hallway. Luckyly a mine in the mountains was going to be expanded by drilling from the west side of a mountain towards the excisting east mine. They needed new workers and you were given a job. Even though the UAC could not really understand what a highly decora- ted and famous marine (and world saviour) wanted in a dirty ol\u00b4 mine. However they let you go and gave you the job. The work was everything you needed: solitude, dirty talking and hard sweaty work.  After a couple of weeks, which fully satisfied your needs, you notised that the Employer always carried a red key on him and he never left it out of sight, much to your suspicion. And sometimes he used it to access the control room in the mines. That was not really the weird thing, the weird thing was the secret door you once saw him enter! And how come the east mine was a restricted area. Something was going on behind these rocky walls and it was not digging. This mine was not only a bit of lava and a rusty drill.  One day, when you were out breathing some fresh air, a terrible and thundering quake shivered the earth under your feet and numerous screams reached you from within the mine. Something was very wrong, very very wrong.  You grap your sidearm and cannot help relating your present feelings to past experiences. And now you come to think of it, you once heard from a drunk security guard from the UAC, at one of the numerous parties celebrating your heroic homecoming, that the UAC were still conducting the same experiments, which lead to the alien invasion of Earth, at some moun- tain top in the desert. Of course he was drunk, so you took no notice of his babbling. However, now it all made sence. YOU were on THAT mountain.  And it is a cooinsidence the fact that YOU are on that mountain sent there by that UAC? Does the east mine at all exist?  Whatever the answer might be, a closer look might be the only thing left to do. And actually, you were getting bored with working a drill and a shovel. The silent, but steady sound of growling and mumbling makes you silently, yet firm and determined say to yourself: \"Lets make that trigger hot again...\"", "credits": "Those weird brains at ID for Doom and its many successors.

There is plenty of ammo to complete the level - if you don't waste it. Make those shots count, Marine! There are no real puzzles to figure out to complete the level. If something seems impossible for you to accomplish, either there is probably another way to get the same results or else you don't HAVE to go that way to complete the level.

Features areas haunted by the ghosts of dead players, some of whom are still firing their guns at you when you pass. Also features INTENTIONAL USE OF THE ARCH-VILE BUG!!! Don't be daunted by the size of this file. It's an excellent deathmatch. It was about 270k before I started putting in the graphics, music, and sounds. And because of its great visibility, it plays a lot smaller than that.
