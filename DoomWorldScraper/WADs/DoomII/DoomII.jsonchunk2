It has 2 new levels (secret levels 31+32) and many bugs of the previous installments in the buzzy series have been fixed. I also revamped the lighting effects and some other architectural fetures. The level order has also been changed. I have added buzzy4.bat for easier playing. Just unzip buzzy4.zip into your Doom2 directory and type 'buzzy4'. And here are descriptions of each level: Map01:Short, easy beginning level (I finally added a secret here!) Map02:A small level and one of the only ones with some sort of theme (a sewerage treatment plant) *Note* the slugde is not deadly in this level Map03:This is a medium-sized level with a really cool staircase Map04:Another average-sized level (built by Jeromy Ritchey) with a long alluminum tunnel Map05:A fairly good sized sized level with a small, easy maze and some other interesting things (Jeromy came up with the concept of building this level completely contained inside the starting semi-circular hallway but I did the rest:) Map06:This is the only other themed level in this wad, it is an abandoned mine (very dark and spooky with some cool light effects) Map07:This is a big level and pretty hard (unless you can find the quick escape secret near the beginning;) it also has a nifty crusher and a tentacle maze Map08:This is one of the best and is filled to the brim with monsters (the best title for this level would be AC/DC...;) Map09:This is the first level I built but is still very good(and the biggest at 194K) the first big arena is truly awesome!!

You don't like this post, but who said you have to. You have a bad feeling about the big hush-hush project being tested today. It's called the High Energy Tranfer system, or H.E.X. for short. The H.E.X. breaks an object down in to sub-atomic particles, sends them to another location, where they are them reassembled in perfect order. At least thats the goal.

The only thing you can do is feel sorry for the poor slob that has to step in to that lab. The test begins. You can hear the hum of the huge generators that power the H.E.X. A funny feeling comes over you, like the one you had when your squad was ambushed three years ago. The lab alarm goeas off and you know it's bad. Grab your shotgun and rush towards the lab complex. Thats when the monsters start to appear. You and your comrades are taken aback by the green flashes of energy and the monsters they leave behind. Some hurl balls of fire, others are are content to gorge themselves on human flesh. You are being overwhelmed. Your freinds fall around you. You lose your shotgun to a fireball. The lab is near. You don't have much of a choice. You look back at the carnage when you reach the door. You watch in horror as the dead that aren't being eaten rise and start taking shots at you. The corpse of your best friend shambles toward you. With regret you frag him, then enter the complex. \"I'm the last one,\" you think as the door closes and locks behind you. All is earily quiet. Maybe you can find a better weapon in here. Maybe there are survivors. maybe, just maybe, you can fire up the H.E.X. and use it to ge out of this hell-hole.

(Kitchen sink WAD) NOTES ON MULTIPLAYER: I originaly designed this level for single player only. Then when I got a real modem, I started playing deathmatch and realized that I somehow had to make this level compatible for deathmatch. (You will see why it's not when you play it single player...) I therefore added several \"deathmatch\" doors. They are all secret doors, so as to not detract from single player play, but can be seen in yellow (or brown) on the map. There is also a giveaway in each texture. (Offlined, slightly different, etc.) The doors require a red key card which you will not be able to find in single player mode. If you try to open a secret and it says it needs a red key card, you have found one of these doors. Don't worry, the secret total will not be affected by these areas. These areas not only make the level deathmatchable, but connect several areas to make the level non-linear. The exit is also a cooperative exit in dmatch. You won't be able to activate it by yourself. It is near the original exit switch, which is blocked in deathmatch. This level can NOT be played cooperatively :(", "credits": "Everybody responsible for the production of the book titled \"Tricks of the DOOM Gurus,\" for producing such a huge well of knowledge about WAD file design.

I dusted it off again when some of the kewl and helpful doodz in #DOOM2 mentioned WadAuthor...<br><br> Well I think this new editor kicks ass (esp the on-screen bitmaps, multiple tag options and map error checking). The result was an obsessive couple of days exploring the architectural abilities of the Doom 2 v1.9 engine... There's a wide variety of themes in this single level, and the map looks cluttered and DAUNTING, but it's actually very clear and concise, with a definite linearity to it. This is helped by the use of the three keys and switches with false panels over them you need to find the releases for. (Hint: Note the mining company logo from Doom 1.)<br><br> If you think there's too many monsters, take the architecture into account. I've used thematic textures a little. There's crushing ceilings for some of the cybies. Narrow shooting slots let you wipe out neighbouring rooms in relative safety (will you be sucked in by the cybie-slot, tee hee). Also, try to get the more conjested areas cleared before you enter by turning the nasties on each other. The opponents I've placed in certain areas have been specially chosen for their detriment on other species.<br><br> I consider this pretty easy to get through; it can take about 20 minutes. It's quite easy to finish the level WITHOUT cheating AFTER you've solved the riddles, but if you really must just have a frag-fest -- or just to initially solve the rotten thing without dying and restarting -- only use the IDFA cheat instead of IDKFA, so you preserve the linearity of the \"story\" without gaining keys prematurely...", "rating_value": "3", "rating_count": "3", "page_visits": "2", "downloads": "3", "creation_date": "1999-05-31", "file_url": "https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/10235-ninjaducks-cybie-sight-seeing-tour/?do=download&csrfKey=efb3a822933a11e6dff7d9221a943632", "game": "DoomII", "category": "m-o", "path": "./WADs/DoomII/Original/ninjaduk_NINJADUK.WAD", "name": "ninjaduk.zip", "tile_path": "./WADs/DoomII/Processed/ninjaduk_NINJADUK_MAP01.txt", "svg_path": "./WADs/DoomII/Processed - Vectorized/ninjaduk_NINJADUK_MAP01.svg"}, {"title": "My First Attempts (Yeah, it took almost a year to finish this DOOM2 stuff :) ", "author": "Dimiter Todorov Georgiev", "description": "Map01: My first level to be released.", "credits": "id & Romero (pity that they don't work together any more...).", "base": "New levels from scratch", "build_time": "Uh ?", "editor_used": "Deu II, Waded (v1.71 beta & v1.83 beta), Deth, Dck (to copy & paste) Deutex (v2.9 & v3.6), Ulead Image Editor for WIN, Edit for DOS RMB - too slow for anything else than special effects - check out the safe sector (# 264) in MAP03, (not any more. rmb was deleted in the Great Holocaust - long before the levels were finished...) etc. P.S.

Theme is hellish and consists of flesh, cave, temple and catacombs levels. Action in final levels takes place in outdoor and base areas. All maps are meant to be played in vanilla, oldschool Doom 2. If you wish to play this in a modern source-port, jumping and crouching must be disabled or else some maps can break. I also recommend disabling freelook, but that's up to you. Ultra-Violence is designed to be tight on ammo and health (but not too tight :)). If you find that too daunting, I recommend switching to Hurt Me Plenty instead. It's not much easier than UV. Even though every level is beatable on Ultra-Violence from pistol start, the WAD has been designed with continuous play in mind. This means that you're supposed to carry over inventory from map to map. Even with this continuity, MAP06 is meant to take away all your inventory on exit and you're supposed to start with pistol only on MAP07. If your source-port fails to do so, I recommend restarting MAP07 from scratch. MAP07 is a gimmick map where players are supposed to win through infights. It's a fairly short one and the only gimmick map in the WAD. It's ensured that maps will never break in cooperative mode. There are no spots where players can die and block other players from completing the level. It's safe to play this with your friend with \"noclip\" cheats off. Also, in multiplayer, a bit more ammo is provided, but it's not very much and WAD is tight on ammo otherwise. I recommend leaving \"multiplayer items\" enabled. Even though this was thoroughly tested in Chocolate Doom for visplane overflows, some maps come dangerously close to savegame size limit.
