The DeHackEd patch changes the level names under the map. Enigmatic Complex is a large wad (it jams up DEU 5.21 and BSP 1.2) that largely takes place inside a large complex. It is the first level of a new doom. It takes me around twenty minutes to complete with 100% on everything, so it will probably take you a little longer. The dificulty goes from easy to hard. In UV you should be able to make it through the fighting without too much trouble, but there are some hairy moments that will probably kill you when you first run across them. The \"marble\" area has 155 monsters. There was originally going to be a lot more to this level (like bathrooms, a mess hall, and secruity cameras), but I ran out of memory. I tried to make this as bug-free as possible without sacrificing parts of the level. I also tried to align every texture (manually). I didn't do one area with pentagon wall textures, because the damn things are to hard to align. Anyway, if you find any bugs, e-mail me. Also, feedback! Please give plenty of feedback!

You don't like this post, but who said you have to. You have a bad feeling about the big hush-hush project being tested today. It's called the High Energy Tranfer system, or H.E.X. for short. The H.E.X. breaks an object down in to sub-atomic particles, sends them to another location, where they are them reassembled in perfect order. At least thats the goal. As the hour for the first human test approaches, you recall the rumors that you heard about the success and failures of the animal tests. Some of them just weren't pretty. The only thing you can do is feel sorry for the poor slob that has to step in to that lab. The test begins. You can hear the hum of the huge generators that power the H.E.X. A funny feeling comes over you, like the one you had when your squad was ambushed three years ago. The lab alarm goeas off and you know it's bad. Grab your shotgun and rush towards the lab complex. Thats when the monsters start to appear. You and your comrades are taken aback by the green flashes of energy and the monsters that appear in their wake. Some hurl balls of fire, others just gorge themselves on human flesh. You are being overwhelmed. Your freinds fall around you. You lose your shotgun to a fireball. The lab is near. You don't have much of a choice. You look back at the carnage when you reach the door. You watch in horror as the dead that aren't being eaten rise and start taking shots at you. The corpse of your best friend shambles toward you. You take him out, then enter the complex. \"I'm the last one,\" you think as the door closes and locks behind you. All is earily quiet. Maybe you can find a better weapon in here. Maybe there are survivors. maybe, just maybe, you can fire up the H.E.X. and use it to ge out of this hell-hole.

This contains most weapons and a fair bit of power-ups. The second is a small central region which is used to gain access to the remaining three city-like areas. These must be opened in sequential order with keycards. The first main area is given the theme of fire, the second being water, and the third being earth.

Sham", "description": "The design of these wads spans three or four time periods thus the name Immortal. It also reflects the game itself. Many changes have occured and we have Quake, Boom, Xdoom and Zdoom to name a few. Some of them include nice enhancements but for me nothing matches the feel and play of the original game.  These levels are designed for all skill levels but they are not easy. UV is better left to the advanced players. All three skill levels present a good challenge and all are fun to play. I recorded each level in UV as part of playtesting. It would be great to see them all recorded as fast as possible. If done I'm sure John Blackburn would post them on his Home Page. Or perhaps the fastest recording of each level by different people! PLease record, we'll post the fastest UV lmps.  The textures are beautiful and reflect what had to be a great amount of work on the part of the Gothic Crew. One of the wads is a showcase for all of the stained glass and was built especially for my wife, as was Camelot.", "credits": "My son (Rich) for his encouragement. My friends Steve and Byarr for their encouragement. My friend John Blackburn for all his help and support. He encouraged me to build this megawad.

You then have your choice of teleporters that take you to different parts of the actual level. Pretty cool huh? Wait till you play it. Also, the only way to get the double barrel shotgun is to flick the switch and lower the lifts. All your opponents know exactly where you are because that is the only switch! So move fast.

A small house turned into a brainwashing station, a barebones office space complete with horrible boss and pinky pit, a nature walk, a pavilion fortress next to both of the parking lot bullies, the toxic computer construction plant, and the guard post guarding your final destination: UAC (not that one, the other one) headquarters. This IS my first map, so player beware. Although I think I've done a good job. Criticism welcome, but construcive is preffered. I tried to test everything: trigger traps, 4 different environments, open and closed areas, hordes, a few strong enemies, etc. Some things I couldn't try in this map, so I'll attempt them in another level sometime. Difficulty is both extremes: easy is a wimpy breeze, normal is a fast-paced fight, but you'll probably have reserves of health and ammo to help you through it. Hard.. well. you'll be greeted by an appropriate message. This is more or less an update to an old wad by the same name, but I had it taken down until I could fix a few pretty big problems, to name a few: a fatty got stuck on a wall, you could slide into a blue key area and basically break the level, an archvile could target you at the start, and I forgot it's basically forbidden to use nazis.
