All keys are needed to reach the exit, but its not necessary to first find a certain key before another one can be found. Just collect all three. No hard puzzles should be solved to find the keys/exit (all doors hiding the keys are automati- cally opened when you get close!), but it is necessary to go around the central point to get them, and that's the hard part ;-) Because all rooms can be reached in many different ways, and have nice ambush spots it's great fun to play deathmatch, although the map is too large for a two-player deathmatch, I guess. A lot of time was spend on choosing the correct texture and aligning them, because I hate it when a level doesn't look good. I think its a tough level, but playable. Tough, not because there are 20 cyberdemons etc. No cyberdemons, no spiderboss!

But as I went on working on my level, I focused my attention more and more on graphics, without disregarding gameplay and difficulty. So expect for a good-looking level and also for a nice and fast-paced challenge! The level isn't to difficult, but the last areas and challenges are very hard... you are warned! The two new fast weapons make the level more fast-paced, just because of their high fire-rate. As I did in its prequel, I inserted the starts for 3 players and I tried to create a level suited for the cooperative mode... and I think that this map is really nice to play it with the cooperative mode (though I couldn't test it!). Weapons, ammo, health (and also monsters) are balanced and suited for a cooperative game! The .WAD doesn't contain any ZDoom effects and it should work with vanilla Doom 2; but I tested my level only with ZDoom (2.0 beta 38).

After your horrifying encounter on Phobos, Deimos, Hell, and Earth, pretty much everything has been going right. You've returned to your post in the middle of nowhere, content with the silence and peace of your area. Suddenly, you hear a strange noise coming from outside. You walk over to a nearby window and look up into the black, dreary night to find an endless amount of void, dark space. Turning back, you hear the same noise again...it sounds like a low rumbling...something you'd hear during a rockslide or avalanche miles away. You don't suspect much until a large ammunition shell crashes through the wall of your outpost. You speed across the hall, followed by gunshots and screams. You quickly speed toward the armory and grab an 12-Gauge shotgun, a .45 pistol and a box of shells. You quickly attempt to load the bullets nervously, but an enormous hole forges its way through the thin lining of the armory's walls. You immediatly flee down the hall, toward the exit. You reach the door, and find your once peaceful friend pale and bruised. He weakly lifts a .22 rifle and aims toward you. You react instantly with two .45 shots straight to the head, killing someone you'd known for years in a single, horrific second of blood and agony. You stare at the limp, pale body in awe of how destructive these evil beings are. Filled with a rage you had banished to the darkest reaches of your soul explodes from you as an Imp emerges from the darkness. He reaches to swipe you dead, but you meet his fist with a well-placed shotgun round to the chest. His red eyes fill with blood, and he collapses toward the floor. You can't help but spit on the mangled corpse that lays upon the floor. Behind you, loud crashing noises and glass breaking hits your ears. You quickly spin 180 degrees to find a horde of demons devouring everything in their path, with no mercy at all. Instead of fighting your way out of this, you use your head and leap out the door. The Demon's ship has appeared, its size larger than any ship you've ever encountered. You wish you could just kill everything and everyone on that ship on one deadly blast. But you know you can't do that. As you stare into the evil visage of the ship, you can't help but notice there are no windows. You now realize that \"Plan A\" isn't going to work. On to plan B. As an Imp bursts through the door of the massive ship, you pump a few shells into the back of his skull. Before the door closes, you dive into the ship and kill a few more aliens. Another Imp bounds out of the lightlessness as you aim your shotgun and fire, hoping to hear the flesh-tearing ammunition fly from the barrel. Instead, you are greeted by an ominous \"click\". Again, you try to fire the gun, but with no luck. The Imp grins at you with a smile that explodes with hatred. He winds back to spurt a fireball as you use the shotgun as a club to smash his ribs into a fine white powder. As he cradles his injury, you use the time to pound his skull in with .45 bullets. You search through the ship, until you come to an area called \"The Barracks\". You open the door, and walk in. A quick, loud smashing sound bursts from behind you. The door is shut. This isn't good...you know this place. It looks exactly like the first area on Phobos... You notice English writing and the same bunks you used to sleep in. You walk back for a while, until you're met by the cold, steel door that entraps you. Where did they get these strange Barracks from?

You are assigned to travel forward 600 years, to a world ruled by the demons, and stop them before they wipe out the few remaining pockets of humanity. You time-travel successfully, to a futuristic metropolis where you are surprised to see your own face on \"Wanted\" posters everywhere. Before you have a chance to slip into hiding, a \"concerned citizen\" reports you to the zombie police, and after a short fight you are taken into custody. It seems that before you travelled in time, you forgot to return a library book... a library book which is now 600 years overdue. Your demonic captors cackle heartily at your lack of an alibi. You are told that you are being taken to see the feared Librarian-Inquisitor. Hours later, as you wait in a holding cell of the library complex, you remember you've still got your trusty pistol and 50 rounds of ammo; what a stroke of luck!

The arrows may not mean a thing in this map and in some ways its fairly simple to complete. There are two ways to speedrun this map within 10 seconds.
