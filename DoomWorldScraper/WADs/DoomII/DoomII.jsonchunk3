The kind of level you can replay many times. So I wanted to do something like that myself. But I also wanted the level to look good, with plenty of details and a nice theme. I decided to use the gothic texture pack rather than the overused original textures, and give it a medieval style. So this is a castle. Since there's a lot of open space, I ended up with a lot of monsters, so gameplay is rather Hell Revealed-styled. Play on skill 2 for a less overwelming experience. You start in a jail, where you have just managed to slay a guard and take his pistol (sounds familiar :-). You want to escape the castle, but to do this you'll need to find three keys for the gate. The best, most challenging way to play this is without saving, that's what I had in mind when designing it, so it should be fun for demo-recording. But you'll need some practice to do this on skill 3 and above, you'll need to know where everything is and get the strategy right. Ration the powerup spheres, and try getting the keys in different orders. Happy dooming!", "credits": "Pascal vd Heiden for Doom Builder - I couldn't have made this level without such a great editor.

Having passed through DANTE'S GATE and survived, you now find yourself in a keep on the shores of the river Acheron. This is the second leg of the journey in your search for Beatrice. Your guide, Virgil, is nowhere to be found. \"He's buggered off!\" you think to yourself; but you have no time now to even think: you are immediately challenged by several Demons, and in the distance you hear the eerie purring of the Arch-Vile. (Just be sure not to stare at him for too long before you start running.) As usual, you dispatch what fiends you may and begin the task at hand.\r\n\r\nYour goal? To get the hell out of this place as quickly as possible and find your beloved Beatrice. You only hope that she has already passed through this hell-hole to a safer haven beyond. If only you could hold her in your arms again, you know what you would say:\r\n\r\n\"Give me some sugar, Babe.\"\r\n\r\nCROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is the second level in a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. The third is VIRGIL'S LEAD. For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.\r\n\r\n(By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).

Having passed through DANTE'S GATE and survived, you now find yourself in a keep on the shores of the river Acheron. This is the second leg of the journey in your search for Beatrice. Your guide, Virgil, is nowhere to be found. \"He's buggered off!\" you think to yourself; but you have no time now to even think: you are immediately challenged by several Demons, and in the distance you hear the eerie purring of the Arch-Vile (just be sure not to stare at him for too long before you start running.) As usual, you dispatch what fiends you may and begin the task at hand.\r\n\r\nYour goal? To get the hell out of this place as quickly as possible and find your beloved Beatrice. You only hope that she has already passed through this hell-hole to a safer haven beyond. If only you could hold her in your arms again, you know what you would say:\r\n\r\n\"Gimme some sugar, Babe.\"\r\n\r\nCROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is the second level in a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's masterwork THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.\r\n\r\n(By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).

This is my first release, so creative criticism please! The plot: While being alone on Earth, you receive an emergency message from Mars. It seems like humanity is in a big trouble again. You take a look at the exact spot of the message from the big computer at your bedroom. Near the north pole of Mars! You grab your wool underwear and the .44 under your bed, and start inputting the coordinates into your Personal Teleporter. Note: Near the north pole of Mars is very cold! That blue liquid isnt water, while all of it is frozen. Its freezing liquid nitrogen, so beware!

So when The Waterfront was done, I decided to do a complete make- over on Reactor. I wanted the Doom 2 monsters so I converted it. I had to borrow a few of the Doom 1 textures to make it look right, namely the episode 1 sky and the sladdrips. Also, since I was never really happy with the Doom 2 music, and since it was looking sort of reminiscent of the Doom 1 levels, I borrowed one of my favorite Doom 1 themes (e1m3).", "credits": "Ben Morris for his excellent editor, DCK and, of course, the folks at Id Software.", "base": "Old Doom 1 version of Reactor", "editor_used": "Doom Construction Kit 2.2 NWT 1.03 Neopaint 2.2 RMB 2.1", "bugs": "None", "rating_value": "4", "rating_count": "6", "page_visits": "6", "downloads": "6", "creation_date": "1995-07-15", "file_url": "https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/2659-reactor-final-version/?do=download&csrfKey=8830ccbf936d3f7f8b27c0aa26f41798", "game": "DoomII", "category": "p-r", "path": "./WADs/DoomII/Original/reactrfv_REACTRFV.WAD", "name": "reactrfv.zip", "tile_path": "./WADs/DoomII/Processed/reactrfv_REACTRFV_MAP01.txt", "svg_path": "./WADs/DoomII/Processed - Vectorized/reactrfv_REACTRFV_MAP01.svg"}, {"title": "paradox 9 (DOOM 2 level) ", "author": "Eric van Bezooijen", "description": "This level is meant to be a deathmatch level, but it can also be used as a \"quickie\" single player level.
