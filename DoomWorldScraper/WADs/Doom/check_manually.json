Feel free to do this yourself. I could have made an incredibly large single level instead of doing 6 separates, but Doom isn't meant to be played in twenty second bursts while your hard disk desperately tries to catch up on your killings. Also, attention spans waver when you are forced to trek across an immense landscape with your blue key to where you think you saw a blue door. No thanks. Any comments welcome. The fact that these were all designed and tested on a 16MHz 386sx should make you appreciate them more. I hope. I've tried them on a DX2, and they were fine, if a little easier. {Thanks to Jason Roycroft for use of his little gem of a PC!} When I first started E1M3, I was actually basing the level on the second floor of the Regional Technical College in Tallaght, Dublin. But it was when I had the mezzanine, the foyer, stairs and labs done that I realised my college wouldn't make for a decent Doom level. So everything after that is my imagination. Now there you go. There is a hidden swimming pool on E1M4, and credits for the original concept go to the author of Swimpool.wad and to Jens Hykkelbjerg, who keeps a good web page on Doom special effects. Dont try and fix any problems with sectors 108 - 110 because they only work by being inconsistent. I've recently added some sounds to the wad, and they replace a few death sounds and others. They are all sampled from audio CD's, so you may recognise a bit of Big Black, The Jesus Lizard, Helmet, Front 242 and Nine Inch Nails. Also contained in the zip is a DeHackEd patch... just something to try to add to the whole Git thing. Edit it freely, because it was made from a lot of other DeHackEd patches. I included it simply because its my favourite one. Copy them, distribute them...blah...etc...If I chance upon these levels on a bbs or ftp site someplace and this file isnt with them there'll be Hell On Earth.

Back in the labs on Kemois, there is a management meeting to decide who will be worthy of test piloting the new IFTIF (Inter-Flux Time Integration Facility) or in simple terms, the time machine. Seeing as you have single handedly kicked out the Hell spawn from Mars 17 Earth Years ago, (Earth time has become the new standard around which, all other planet time is aranged, a bit like GMT on Earth.) you are one of the canidates for the task. General Waskity has selected a spot from which to launch the IFTIF, quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8 - the slums of Kemois. Now, the Department of Defence has been informed by scientists, that the IFTIF will not send people through space, only time, therefore, quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8 was selected because on 12/02/28 it is commonly known that the Hell Spawn were not resident in the area. Military intelligence proves that. Seeing as this is a test flight the Department of Defence did not want to send you in to a populated area. I know, you are thinking, well why don't they send you further back? The reason is that the human body cannot with stand traveling more that 20 years at a time, we think, you may transport back 20 years, and then back another 20 years, but not 40 at once, see? The area that has been selected for launch is barren, this way the military do not risk sending you into a populated area thus you will meet no resistance and there is no possibility of any encounters of any kind. Well, you are seated outside the briefing room, you watch the top dogs discussing your future through a partially open door, then, they come out. You are approached, and General Waskity places his hand on your shoulder and says, \"Son, you are going to be taking one small step for bioman, and one giant leap for bioman kind.\" There is a loud round of applause as you smile, you have been waiting for something exciting ever since you came out of therepy as a result of the invasion. You are sent to the specially constructed IFTIF truck, you see the time pad at one end, you are at the other. All along the walls of the truck there is computer machinary. The truck sets off for quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8. As you arrive, General Waskity speaks:- \"Make us proud son!\" You think to yourself, \"military intelligence got me into a mess through the invasion, I hope it is more accurate now. I hope there is nothing out there except the pad home.\" They then walk out of the truck and seal the door. All you have to do is walk over to that time pad......let's hope that there is no building, just a desert!!!!

This map consists of 4 sections that I'm sure you will enjoy it. Users Guide: At the beginning you will be in the first section which includes the big grey saloon, the patio and the metallic corridors. Then, the other sections are the Catacombs and the Sewer. The latest one is the Red room which contains the Blue key necessary to open the door and exit the game. Keep playing ! you finally will be at the Red room. In the game you will pass close to the Red room, but you need the yellow key to enter in it. (there is not red key for the Red room). I recommend that you enter into the Red room using the door inside the red corridor, not the door in front of the shiny metallic corridor. Press the switch and quickly leave this room from the same direction you came inside (if you are still alive), then go around thru the shiny hall and enter into the Red room thru the other door. Into the Red room, for your protection from the Cyberdemon, there is a little bunker that you can hide and think. Close to the bunker you almost can see the Rocket Launcher and boxes of rockets, if the Cyber is not around (he is deaf), then leave the bunker and try to get this arsenal. Once you get this, isn't necessary to turn around looking for the Bunker, since a teleporter inside a little room in front of the rockets will send you back to the Bunker. Now that you got this arsenal, try to leave the bunker by the door that you came in, go around thru the shiny hall and attack the Cyber from the windows or from the other entrance. Don't get to close to these windows, he will fire at you! If you run out of rockets use the machine gun or the shotgun. If you are smart, he will die. By killing the Cyber will be easier to get the blue key. Be ready to save your game many times in this section !

However, one of the satellites used to scoop samples recently passed close to the Martian moons. After the Scorpio base recovered the satellite for examination, chaos broke out and communications with the base cut off. A trouble- shooter sent to assess the situation disappeared.

If the person/ monster is still standing on the materialization point when you arrive there, they will be blown to bits... (known as tele-fragging) any Monster, or a player with any health will be instantly blown up... pretty effective to kill your opponent.

Some \"dead-ends\" have ways out that are not apparent so you don't get trapped in a corner by your opponent (on a deathmatch). This level isn't quite as big as I would have liked it to be, due to a problem with DoomEd. Due to the complexity of some of the rooms (multiple sectors inside of sectors), I couldn't add as many rooms as I would've liked without DoomEd bombing out. Oh well. All of the weapons that were available on the original E1M2 are available on my level (best you can get is the rocket launcher).  K3.WAD: This level works good as a single, multi, or deathmatch level. If you decide to play Deathmatch or multi-player cooperative, extra items will be added to help you out. There are (as usual) many secret passages that tie the rooms together, so rooms that look like dead-ends may not really be.
