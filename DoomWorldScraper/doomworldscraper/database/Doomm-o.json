It was meticulously detailed and should be aesthetically pleasing to those who are not sick of the tech base theme. Think of it as a nostalgic ode to the early DOOM experience.\r\n\r\nA little history: I was 13 when I first played DOOM. The level of engagement (and fear) that I felt when I first played it on a 386 with a PC speaker is something I have not felt since those days in any modern game. I guess our imagination was more developed back then. I was absolutely blown away by the detail and realism I saw when walking through the creepy halls of the various military bases. \r\n\r\nWhen I first heard that people were creating their own maps in 1994, I was intrigued and fascinated by what I thought was an impossibly complicated process. I experimented with mapping back then using Doom Editor - The Real Thing by Geoff Allan, in Windows 3.1. It crashed all the time. I also found it difficult to convert my ideas into an actual map. I gave up after loosing my progress a few too many times. \r\n\r\nFast-forward 20 years to 2013, and I stumbled across a website for Doom Builder 2. I was shocked to find out that there was a map editor for Doom, and that it was developed in the 2000s. Since I was not a gamer and rarely played video games at all (except for a short stint of obsession with GTA4), I thought Doom modding died a long time ago. I downloaded the map editor and started to experiment. I was amazed at how rock solid Doom Builder was. (To this day, it has not crashed a single time, nor have I ever noticed a single bug.)\r\n\r\nIt was on. I started to map out a few ideas and quickly became obsessed. It was so easy to draw out exactly what I was thinking, and the 3D mode was blowing my mind. I started to work on an E1 episode like I had always wanted to since the 90s. \r\n\r\nThis level is the 2nd map of the episode. It is also the 2nd map I make (ever). The first is complete, and the 3rd is half done. I liked how this one turned out. Halfway through the development of this map, I discovered the PWAD archive and the Doom World forum. I had NO IDEA there was still a huge community of Doom playing and modding. I started to download some maps. When I saw how far mapping has come, I was reluctant to release this. My map comes from someone who last played doom in the 90s so it really was styled to what I thought was the ultimate style. But I still really like the tech base style and figured some people might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is the 2nd map I have ever made.", "base": "New from scratch", "build_time": "A few months, on/off", "editor_used": "Doom Builder 2", "rating_value": "4.3", "rating_count": "16", "page_visits": "UserPageVisits:56", "downloads": "UserDownloads:34", "creation_date": "2015-07-09", "file_url": "https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/18145-auxiliary-base-e1m2/?do=download&csrfKey=d532f9146680f39d4e4af2326b63f4fb", "game": "Doom", "category": ["a-c", "https://www.doomworld.com/files/category/66-a-c/", []], "path": "./database/doom/a-c/auxbase.zip", "name": "auxbase.zip"}, {"title": "Control Center ", "author": "Diego Cea (Doomer)", "description": "Control Center is a map I made some weeks ago, based on the 90's mapping style.

This is the level as I originally intended it, and I hope that you enjoy it. As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think the level is just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in DEATHMATCH as in Single-player and Co\u00f6perative modes. CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is part of a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.

It is the first level of a new Doom. It takes me around twenty minutes to complete with 100% on everything, so it will probably take you a little longer. The dificulty goes from easy to hard.

Main features: - VERY large level, guaranteed to be one of the largest Doom levels you'll ever find. More than 400k for a single level, WITHOUT using any gimmick extras. - intended to be fun, not extremely difficult. This is no \"Plutonia Experiment\" only suitable for some Doom Gods. Try and find the correct skill level for you, there's one for sure. - optimized for speed: it includes a built-in REJECT resource with a 94% efficiency, for the fastest possible gameplay. - absolutely NO bugs: no HOM's, Medusa effects, tutti-frutti, tall walls, nothing. It's been thoroughly tested and it's bug-free. Besides, despite its size, you CAN save the game at any moment, it will not overflow the savegame buffer, as it happens with other large levels. - truly non-linear geometrically: there are many distinct, interconnected paths through the level. - truly non-linear strategically: there are several different ways to kill most of the big bosses. - extreme attention paid to detail: all textures aligned, lighting, illumination effects, aesthetically pleasing architecture and color combinations, etc - single player, cooperative (4 starts) and deathmatch (4 starts), plus all difficulty levels implemented: from a difficulty ratio of 0.605 at \"I'm too young to die\" (skill 1) to 1.476 at \"Ultra-violence\" (skill 4) - hundreds of enemies (more than 220) of all types for you to defeat, without being a continuous, brainless massacre: you'll have to stop and think a little from time to time. - all weapons included, all items, all power-ups, all keys are used and necessary to exit. - no dead-ends, all secret doors marked somehow, no obscure puzzles to ruin the fun, but expect pits, traps and some *very* nasty ambushes. - a complete test of your Doom abilities: you'll need speed, accuracy, reflexes, smarts, and at some places, a lot of balance, patience, and luck. - it *doesn't* include anything not found in the original Doom: new sounds, textures, dehack patches, special effects, etc. It tries to excel by its architecture, aesthetics, theme, and playability alone, using just original Doom elements, like >id< did in the first place. - and finally, it's a theme level. The theme is as follows:  \"At my early stages of Doom-playing, the most feared enemy was the Cyberdemon. I always found it very difficult to deal with it, and it took me quite a lot of time to defeat the first one. Then I began to think in how many possible ways could a Cyberdemon be killed. Of course, you could always kill it by brute force, in the open (say with a BFG-9000 or so), but after chewing it a while, I discovered several other interesting ways ...\" That's the theme of this level. You'll enter the Cyberdemon's Realm. It's a huge, magnificent fortress, heavily guarded by hundreds of lesser monsters, where the Cyberdemon Kings rule. Your mission is to exterminate every one of them, and exit the fortress alive. You'll have to decide your strategy individually for each of the Cyberdemon Kings. Some you could try to kill using a powerful weapon. Some you could lead to a devious trap. Some you could turn their subdit monsters against them. Some you could fire at from a suitable shelter ... As you'll see, there is *more than one way* to kill them. It's up to you to decide how, and make the necessary arrangements. And be careful with your ammo. At the higher difficulty levels, you will have to think before shooting, or else risk being defenceless in the Realm ... \"", "base": "New level from scratch", "editor_used": "DoomCAD 4.2 for designing the level BSP 12x for building the node tree RMB 3.0 for building the REJECT resource WADWHAT 1.1 for the level's info (see ALBILLO.NFO)", "bugs": "none at all, if run with Ultimate Doom 1.9 or Doom 1.9.

The good news is you have a chainsaw that never runs out of gasoline. Your problem to cut your way through hell until you find a way out. Sounds like the leadin to a TV show doesn't it. Each week watch as out intrepid space marines cut their way through another part of hell. Seeking the exit that will eventually get them out. In order to get character interaction. You do it in coop mode. Have the guys at ID software do the voices of the players with faces animated against standard doom textures. Record the action scenes from the doom wad as it is played in coop mode by three to four players. Cut between animation of conversation and the action as scene by the players to make the final cut of the show. Do a different wad each week. You could make it in your home on a strong pc with a really good interface board. Invite military people to design wads that illustrate small group tactics and weapons choice based on enemy and terrain. Invite ministers to write sermons based on the faults and vices of demons and how terrible a place hell is, and you could get both the militia, 2nd amendment people and Christian fundamentalists to tune in every week. Include a magazine sub, with a monthly disk containing the wads to be played in upcoming shows of the series, so the watchers can play through first and then compare their method of taking the wad to the one on the show when it comes up. Talk about your interactive tv. Wow, you come up with some strange ideas when you are bored. OK. I decided to write some wad files because I was bored. Day one. Trying to follow the lessons in secrets of the doom programming gurus step by step. NOGO. So, I stopped at lesson one and spent the entire day practicing drawing singleroom sectors. No changes in elevation, no doors, no lifts. The only special linetype in the wad is the exit switch. Play is based on narrow tight terrain with monsters around the corner and in the next room. The chainsaw is the weapon of choice in this terrain. Use it. Day two, still practicing drawing sectors, this time with changes in floor height and setting sectors inside of sectors. One really big abyss with lots of platforms at different heights. Weapon of choice, the rocket Launcher, try shooting the muzzle flashes of the cacodemons as they shoot at you from the darkness. If they get close enough to see them, they are almost close enough for the explosion from the rocket to hurt you. Move fast shoot hard, and get out. Day three. Practice with special sectors, doors, crushing ceilings, crushing floors, one teleport. Lines that open secret doors. Lots of no humans signs. Weapon of choice, shotgun, chainsaw, rocket launcher, plasma gun. Enjoy. Day four. Waded crashed and wads saved would crash doom. Loaded a wad from wadcat1 and removed everything but one chamber and built on that. This worked. Key weapons chainsaw, shotgun, demon fratricide and crushing ceilings. Also rocket launcher. But watch out. Day five, afraid waded would crash, so built behind the blue door sector of day 4 wad. Pretty blue scenery. Interesting surprise at end. Day six. Starting to get good. Emphasis on chainsaw and infighting. Close tight terrain with enemies coming out of the walls. Must use demon fratricide to make it to exit. Interesting use of terrain to limit cyberdemons firing effectiveness. Day Seven. Effort to maximize 3d effects of doom space. Several footballfields big terrain with four different sets of passages and chambers at different levels crossing each other. Lost souls have amazing freedom of movement due to vertical shafts. Textures used on elevation 2 so gross messed my stomach. Nasty tough vision of industrial hell. Weapons used, everything, but especially the chaingun. Day eight, finished day seven. I don't know if I will ever write another wad. This was fun but exhausting. I tried logging on to the bbs listed in waded but couldn't. Oh, well. The six days have been combined using wadmerge into one episode of six missions for doom1.

But open spaces are also provided for those all out battles. Most heavy firepower is heavily guarded by monsters or hidden. The only easy weapon to get in single player mode is the shotgun. All the weapons are present. This level is mostly hack, slash, ambush + puzzle type. For more information consult the other .txt files in this archive. There now go kill something...

Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think once you get inside, you'll find that CROSSING ACHERON has been fully optimized for DEATHMATCH. But it's just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in Single-player and Co\u00f6perative modes.\r\n\r\nCROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is a sequel to DANTE'S GATE -- thematically, anyway. (It's an E1M3 only because I thought the music was more appropriate than M2.) For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.\r\n\r\n(By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically). But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)\r\n\r\nI thank those of you who sent me mail on my previous effort, and I hope to hear from more of you about this one.

The top, tech-level floor has the big-mommas. So the flow of battle is upward. It tends to be a pretty fast-paced kill- fest. There are plenty of places to commit suicide, for those so inclined 8^) Note that there are 2 exits to this level. Note also that this level is a secret level. The first exit is the normal exit. The hidden exit (nearby) brings you back to this same secret level. So it is possible to loop this level. This makes it easy to play to a certain number of kills.

This one uses the same texture resources as Amalthea's Apostasy except for a different sky. Several flats are repeated because 2 different alpha doom versions were employed as the source of the pack used, I didn't want to clean that up because I didn't want to have problems with the patches and the textures so I renamed all the textures while keeping the patches names the same and because some patches are the same graphic but have different name the extensive work just to save 2 mb would be annoying. As usual, you will find emphasis on the layouts. Intrincate levels, curvy sectors but with harmonious shapes, non linearity and the interconnectiveness of levels to be feel as a whole are among the main goals and it goes the same with the nostalgia feeling, apealing of doom1 like structures and the alpha texturing as a special feature. As usual too I was disputed on gameplay, but I've tried to be balanced in terms of health, armor and weaponry the same way as in Amalthea's episode. Some traps will increase the difficulty on some poits but I've provided the necessary items to survive them. Not relying on doom2 monsters, avoiding teleport ambushes and the interconnected and open nature of my own layouts themselves are somehow main constrains when trying to provide some varied and chanllenging gameplay. Sorry for begging off too much but I'm a bit fed up about people talking about dull monster placement and afterwards they complain about hitscanners, crossfire and crappy autoaim.

I used circa 95% of the textures because some of them looked really crappy and in addition I edited some of them using some original patches contained in the alphas which wheren't used at all or \"missused\" like the tech ones which in the available textures are cut at some point. About 2/3 of these textures are used in Doom and Doom2 as well, some with minor modifications so the levels will look like E1 and E2 melted, with emphasis on the alpha look but not being extremely poor. I didn't rely on teleport ambushes this time, just as original Doom was, but monster closets are numerous, keeping the gameplay fluid.

I joined in after Phobosdeimos1 left early in the map's development and I joined in afterwards. I did a lot of the western half of the map and Mr. Chris did a lot of the eastern half, but there are many points where we both worked on the same areas, so you really can't tell who did what. (Since Mr. Chris is a much more popular mapper than I am, I assume people probably can recognize his mapping style) Of course, ol' faithful here was rejected from the project for being about twice the size of E2M7 and having over two hundred monsters, among other things. Eventually Mr. Chris released the DTWID version of this level as \"the damned,\" which you can find here on /idgames. Meanwhile, as I gained more knowledge about mapping I dinked around a bit and made a few adjustments here and there to help with the map's flow and progression. A few bugs were also fixed, and a couple of things were added here and there to add character.  For those who haven't played this level before (most of you, I would assume), you may need to use your automap more than a few times because this map is VERY large and VERY non-linear. You may also need to wear eye protection, since it's twice as ugly as it is big. (Remember, it's DTWID so we had to channel our inner Sandy Petersen!)

The base level is around 270kb ! The sounds and MIDI equal around 310kb! And this .TXT file alone is bigger than most peoples' complete WAD's.\r\n\r\n The MIDI file that I included was written exclusively for an SB16 or compatible - that means FM Synthesis. I felt that writing for this platform would be about the best way to convey the music to a general audience. If you have one of those wave-table synthesis jobs...Well, good for you and your good taste (again!). I, unfortunately, just have the wonderful FM synthesis to work with (and so do millions of other users). I just figured that the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few (where have I heard that before?). Now, if you want to talk about 16 bit 44.1khz digital audio samples... That's opening another can of Imps...GOTHIC MIDI mostly deals with \"CD quality\" samples for use with synths and samplers...Be on the lookout for GOTHIC files on C-Serve...\r\n\r\n If you find this file to be too big in size...Maybe your Nintendo is calling for you!

There are lots of little nooks and crannies scattered about, and (I hope) a few surprises. Here is the storyline, if you want one: After all this wackiness at the UAC base, you have lost track of your lady-friend, BEATRICE. How the two of you ever got separated is no great mystery, what with all these demons and devils running about, but you're damned if you're going to go through Hell for nothing. The only other survivor besides yourself and Beatrice is VIRGIL, the beatnik space poet. He last saw Beatrice by one of the warp-gates.

Spare no caution! 4: Ammo is quite transient; use only what you have to and be careful what type you use. 5: Moving objects are much harder to hit than ones that just stand there and let themselves be shot...:) Once again, this level gets much easier with practice, making it fun to come in on a fleshing rampage once you get good at it!", "credits": "Extreme thanks to Raphael Quinet and Brendon Wyber for creating DOOM EDITOR UTILITIES and to id Software for creating that awesome gaming experience; DOOM!

The platform drops if you tap the side from one of the lower halls. On the upper level, however, if as you are sprinting across you tap the space-bar(or whatever opens doors for you) the platform will also drop. This means that whoever is chasing you will suddenly be on the lower level. One other interesting feature: in the center (on the platform) is an arrow it points toward the room with the rocket launcher. Whenever someone goes for it, this arrow will turn black and there will be a black arrow on the ceiling, alerting the other players. There is a co-op exit in the eastern crushing hall.

Your excitement at the thought that you may be about to come face-to-face with Cilla Black is replaced by horror, fear and, shortly thereafter, a foul smell coming from within your underwear as you hear hideous grunts and groans accompanied by the piercing screams of some of TV's top variety performers. Clutching a plastic pistol in front of you with both hands, you edge towards the TV screen as the frightening realisation hits you - only you can save Jimmy Tarbuck! Hang on. Does anyone know what the hell I'm talking about? Thought not. Pah! Stories so far ... who needs 'em? # E1M1 - The cloak-rooms of hell # In this episode you play a disgruntled lavatory attendant trying to win back the affections of a mass of hideously evil, yet at the same time cute and loveable, cholera viruses (virii?). No, I lie (again). I consider this level to be the 'main' part of this little escapade, in that it's fairly playable and has a nice smattering of variety. [...] # E1M2 - Fiddler on the roof # After you've escaped from the cloak-rooms of hell, what do you do next? You climb on the roof to have a fiddle of course. This is another one of those pointless monster overkill levels, derived from the previous level but very different in terms of both the scenery and the playing. It's not very complex, as by this time I was getting a little tired of continual level-editing, but it's far from being easy, mainly because you can soon find yourself fighting almost every monster on the level simultaneously.

After a two-hour talk, UAC has agreed to send all their present information to them, if they do the same on Talay. The story is sent through a portal and into the hands of government officials. Here's the jist of it: They have been useing advanced technology for the last 25 years, and didn't want the ideas to be stolen before they could lock 'em. Now the procedure is finished. They can put anything into this \"black hole\" and have it appear anywhere in the galaxy. The only problem is that anything can beam back. Throughout the year, strange things have been coming through, weird bugs, artifacts, even an egg. It seems as though another race is toying with them. The Talains have taken on an evil way, being so caught up in protecting their software, they take humans and do insane expiriments, like testing how long they can survive while being flooded with Carbon Monoxide, and trapping them. But the test subjects, or logs, have been on strike. they've been kiling everyone and everything they find.

I therefore added several \"deathmatch\" doors. They are all secret doors, so as to not detract from single player play, but can be seen in yellow (or brown) on the map. There is also a giveaway in each texture. (Offlined, slightly different, etc.) The doors require a red key card which you will not be able to find in single player mode. If you try to open a secret and it says it needs a red key card, you have found one of these doors. Don't worry, the secret total will not be affected by these areas. These areas not only make the level deathmatchable, but connect several areas to make the level non-linear. The exit is also a cooperative exit in dmatch. You won't be able to activate it by yourself. It is near the original exit switch, which is blocked in deathmatch.

Feel free to do this yourself. I could have made an incredibly large single level instead of doing 6 separates, but Doom isn't meant to be played in twenty second bursts while your hard disk desperately tries to catch up on your killings. Also, attention spans waver when you are forced to trek across an immense landscape with your blue key to where you think you saw a blue door. No thanks. Any comments welcome. The fact that these were all designed and tested on a 16MHz 386sx should make you appreciate them more. I hope. I've tried them on a DX2, and they were fine, if a little easier. {Thanks to Jason Roycroft for use of his little gem of a PC!} When I first started E1M3, I was actually basing the level on the second floor of the Regional Technical College in Tallaght, Dublin. But it was when I had the mezzanine, the foyer, stairs and labs done that I realised my college wouldn't make for a decent Doom level. So everything after that is my imagination. Now there you go.

There are a lot of secret areas in this level, so keep your eyes out for strange looking walls and the like. Also, there are multiple teleporters, and you'll learn what they look like. (I have found teleportation to be quite an effective mode of travel) Also, while playing this level on deathmatch, I discovered a neat trick to kill another player or monster. If you can get a player or monster to step through a teleporter, follow him/her/it. If the person/ monster is still standing on the materialization point when you arrive there, they will be blown to bits... (known as tele-fragging) any Monster, or a player with any health will be instantly blown up... pretty effective to kill your opponent. Since this level replaces Episode 1, Map 1, the best weapon you can get is the Rocket Launcher... K2.WAD: This level is set up for single or multiplayer use. Some \"dead-ends\" have ways out that are not apparent so you don't get trapped in a corner by your opponent (on a deathmatch). This level isn't quite as big as I would have liked it to be, due to a problem with DoomEd. Due to the complexity of some of the rooms (multiple sectors inside of sectors), I couldn't add as many rooms as I would've liked without DoomEd bombing out. Oh well. All of the weapons that were available on the original E1M2 are available on my level (best you can get is the rocket launcher).  K3.WAD: This level works good as a single, multi, or deathmatch level. If you decide to play Deathmatch or multi-player cooperative, extra items will be added to help you out. There are (as usual) many secret passages that tie the rooms together, so rooms that look like dead-ends may not really be. Also, since this replaces E1M3, the secret level can be gotten to from this level. Since this WAD is made to replace E1M3, the best weapon you can get is the rocket launcher. K4.WAD: Well, this is the fourth level of mine. I think it is better than the others, mainly in that the construction is more complex sice I switched to DEU... Umm... lessee, It's fun to play alone, but it's even better with one or more \"friends\" for cooperative or :) deathmatch.. It's called the mazeworks because there are three seperate mazes, none too complex, but one with some walls that won't be on the map... have fun with that one.

Back in the labs on Kemois, there is a management meeting to decide who will be worthy of test piloting the new IFTIF (Inter-Flux Time Integration Facility) or in simple terms, the time machine. Seeing as you have single handedly kicked out the Hell spawn from Mars 17 Earth Years ago, (Earth time has become the new standard around which, all other planet time is aranged, a bit like GMT on Earth.) you are one of the canidates for the task. General Waskity has selected a spot from which to launch the IFTIF, quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8 - the slums of Kemois. Now, the Department of Defence has been informed by scientists, that the IFTIF will not send people through space, only time, therefore, quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8 was selected because on 12/02/28 it is commonly known that the Hell Spawn were not resident in the area. Military intelligence proves that. Seeing as this is a test flight the Department of Defence did not want to send you in to a populated area. I know, you are thinking, well why don't they send you further back? The reason is that the human body cannot with stand traveling more that 20 years at a time, we think, you may transport back 20 years, and then back another 20 years, but not 40 at once, see? The area that has been selected for launch is barren, this way the military do not risk sending you into a populated area thus you will meet no resistance and there is no possibility of any encounters of any kind. Well, you are seated outside the briefing room, you watch the top dogs discussing your future through a partially open door, then, they come out. You are approached, and General Waskity places his hand on your shoulder and says, \"Son, you are going to be taking one small step for bioman, and one giant leap for bioman kind.\" There is a loud round of applause as you smile, you have been waiting for something exciting ever since you came out of therepy as a result of the invasion. You are sent to the specially constructed IFTIF truck, you see the time pad at one end, you are at the other. All along the walls of the truck there is computer machinary. The truck sets off for quadrent Alpha B, sector J7GH8. As you arrive, General Waskity speaks:- \"Make us proud son!\" You think to yourself, \"military intelligence got me into a mess through the invasion, I hope it is more accurate now. I hope there is nothing out there except the pad home.\" They then walk out of the truck and seal the door. All you have to do is walk over to that time pad......let's hope that there is no building, just a desert!!!!
