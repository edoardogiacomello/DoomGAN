It was meticulously detailed and should be aesthetically pleasing to those who are not sick of the tech base theme. Think of it as a nostalgic ode to the early DOOM experience.\r\n\r\nA little history: I was 13 when I first played DOOM. The level of engagement (and fear) that I felt when I first played it on a 386 with a PC speaker is something I have not felt since those days in any modern game. I guess our imagination was more developed back then. I was absolutely blown away by the detail and realism I saw when walking through the creepy halls of the various military bases. \r\n\r\nWhen I first heard that people were creating their own maps in 1994, I was intrigued and fascinated by what I thought was an impossibly complicated process. I experimented with mapping back then using Doom Editor - The Real Thing by Geoff Allan, in Windows 3.1. It crashed all the time. I also found it difficult to convert my ideas into an actual map. I gave up after loosing my progress a few too many times. \r\n\r\nFast-forward 20 years to 2013, and I stumbled across a website for Doom Builder 2. I was shocked to find out that there was a map editor for Doom, and that it was developed in the 2000s. Since I was not a gamer and rarely played video games at all (except for a short stint of obsession with GTA4), I thought Doom modding died a long time ago. I downloaded the map editor and started to experiment. I was amazed at how rock solid Doom Builder was. (To this day, it has not crashed a single time, nor have I ever noticed a single bug.)\r\n\r\nIt was on. I started to map out a few ideas and quickly became obsessed. It was so easy to draw out exactly what I was thinking, and the 3D mode was blowing my mind. I started to work on an E1 episode like I had always wanted to since the 90s. \r\n\r\nThis level is the 2nd map of the episode. It is also the 2nd map I make (ever). The first is complete, and the 3rd is half done. I liked how this one turned out. Halfway through the development of this map, I discovered the PWAD archive and the Doom World forum. I had NO IDEA there was still a huge community of Doom playing and modding. I started to download some maps. When I saw how far mapping has come, I was reluctant to release this. My map comes from someone who last played doom in the 90s so it really was styled to what I thought was the ultimate style. But I still really like the tech base style and figured some people might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is the 2nd map I have ever made.", "base": "New from scratch", "build_time": "A few months, on/off", "editor_used": "Doom Builder 2", "rating_value": "4.3", "rating_count": "16", "page_visits": "UserPageVisits:56", "downloads": "UserDownloads:34", "creation_date": "2015-07-09", "file_url": "https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/18145-auxiliary-base-e1m2/?do=download&csrfKey=d532f9146680f39d4e4af2326b63f4fb", "game": "Doom", "category": ["a-c", "https://www.doomworld.com/files/category/66-a-c/", []], "path": "./database/doom/a-c/auxbase.zip", "name": "auxbase.zip"}, {"title": "Control Center ", "author": "Diego Cea (Doomer)", "description": "Control Center is a map I made some weeks ago, based on the 90's mapping style.

This is the level as I originally intended it, and I hope that you enjoy it. As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think the level is just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in DEATHMATCH as in Single-player and Co\u00f6perative modes. CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is part of a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.

It is the first level of a new Doom. It takes me around twenty minutes to complete with 100% on everything, so it will probably take you a little longer. The dificulty goes from easy to hard.

Main features: - VERY large level, guaranteed to be one of the largest Doom levels you'll ever find. More than 400k for a single level, WITHOUT using any gimmick extras. - intended to be fun, not extremely difficult. This is no \"Plutonia Experiment\" only suitable for some Doom Gods. Try and find the correct skill level for you, there's one for sure. - optimized for speed: it includes a built-in REJECT resource with a 94% efficiency, for the fastest possible gameplay. - absolutely NO bugs: no HOM's, Medusa effects, tutti-frutti, tall walls, nothing. It's been thoroughly tested and it's bug-free. Besides, despite its size, you CAN save the game at any moment, it will not overflow the savegame buffer, as it happens with other large levels. - truly non-linear geometrically: there are many distinct, interconnected paths through the level. - truly non-linear strategically: there are several different ways to kill most of the big bosses. - extreme attention paid to detail: all textures aligned, lighting, illumination effects, aesthetically pleasing architecture and color combinations, etc - single player, cooperative (4 starts) and deathmatch (4 starts), plus all difficulty levels implemented: from a difficulty ratio of 0.605 at \"I'm too young to die\" (skill 1) to 1.476 at \"Ultra-violence\" (skill 4) - hundreds of enemies (more than 220) of all types for you to defeat, without being a continuous, brainless massacre: you'll have to stop and think a little from time to time. - all weapons included, all items, all power-ups, all keys are used and necessary to exit. - no dead-ends, all secret doors marked somehow, no obscure puzzles to ruin the fun, but expect pits, traps and some *very* nasty ambushes. - a complete test of your Doom abilities: you'll need speed, accuracy, reflexes, smarts, and at some places, a lot of balance, patience, and luck. - it *doesn't* include anything not found in the original Doom: new sounds, textures, dehack patches, special effects, etc. It tries to excel by its architecture, aesthetics, theme, and playability alone, using just original Doom elements, like >id< did in the first place. - and finally, it's a theme level. The theme is as follows:  \"At my early stages of Doom-playing, the most feared enemy was the Cyberdemon. I always found it very difficult to deal with it, and it took me quite a lot of time to defeat the first one. Then I began to think in how many possible ways could a Cyberdemon be killed. Of course, you could always kill it by brute force, in the open (say with a BFG-9000 or so), but after chewing it a while, I discovered several other interesting ways ...\" That's the theme of this level. You'll enter the Cyberdemon's Realm. It's a huge, magnificent fortress, heavily guarded by hundreds of lesser monsters, where the Cyberdemon Kings rule. Your mission is to exterminate every one of them, and exit the fortress alive. You'll have to decide your strategy individually for each of the Cyberdemon Kings. Some you could try to kill using a powerful weapon. Some you could lead to a devious trap. Some you could turn their subdit monsters against them. Some you could fire at from a suitable shelter ... As you'll see, there is *more than one way* to kill them. It's up to you to decide how, and make the necessary arrangements. And be careful with your ammo. At the higher difficulty levels, you will have to think before shooting, or else risk being defenceless in the Realm ... \"", "base": "New level from scratch", "editor_used": "DoomCAD 4.2 for designing the level BSP 12x for building the node tree RMB 3.0 for building the REJECT resource WADWHAT 1.1 for the level's info (see ALBILLO.NFO)", "bugs": "none at all, if run with Ultimate Doom 1.9 or Doom 1.9.

The good news is you have a chainsaw that never runs out of gasoline. Your problem to cut your way through hell until you find a way out. Sounds like the leadin to a TV show doesn't it. Each week watch as out intrepid space marines cut their way through another part of hell. Seeking the exit that will eventually get them out. In order to get character interaction. You do it in coop mode. Have the guys at ID software do the voices of the players with faces animated against standard doom textures. Record the action scenes from the doom wad as it is played in coop mode by three to four players. Cut between animation of conversation and the action as scene by the players to make the final cut of the show. Do a different wad each week. You could make it in your home on a strong pc with a really good interface board. Invite military people to design wads that illustrate small group tactics and weapons choice based on enemy and terrain. Invite ministers to write sermons based on the faults and vices of demons and how terrible a place hell is, and you could get both the militia, 2nd amendment people and Christian fundamentalists to tune in every week. Include a magazine sub, with a monthly disk containing the wads to be played in upcoming shows of the series, so the watchers can play through first and then compare their method of taking the wad to the one on the show when it comes up. Talk about your interactive tv. Wow, you come up with some strange ideas when you are bored. OK. I decided to write some wad files because I was bored. Day one. Trying to follow the lessons in secrets of the doom programming gurus step by step. NOGO. So, I stopped at lesson one and spent the entire day practicing drawing singleroom sectors. No changes in elevation, no doors, no lifts. The only special linetype in the wad is the exit switch. Play is based on narrow tight terrain with monsters around the corner and in the next room. The chainsaw is the weapon of choice in this terrain. Use it. Day two, still practicing drawing sectors, this time with changes in floor height and setting sectors inside of sectors. One really big abyss with lots of platforms at different heights. Weapon of choice, the rocket Launcher, try shooting the muzzle flashes of the cacodemons as they shoot at you from the darkness. If they get close enough to see them, they are almost close enough for the explosion from the rocket to hurt you. Move fast shoot hard, and get out. Day three. Practice with special sectors, doors, crushing ceilings, crushing floors, one teleport. Lines that open secret doors. Lots of no humans signs. Weapon of choice, shotgun, chainsaw, rocket launcher, plasma gun. Enjoy. Day four. Waded crashed and wads saved would crash doom. Loaded a wad from wadcat1 and removed everything but one chamber and built on that. This worked. Key weapons chainsaw, shotgun, demon fratricide and crushing ceilings. Also rocket launcher. But watch out. Day five, afraid waded would crash, so built behind the blue door sector of day 4 wad. Pretty blue scenery. Interesting surprise at end. Day six. Starting to get good. Emphasis on chainsaw and infighting. Close tight terrain with enemies coming out of the walls. Must use demon fratricide to make it to exit. Interesting use of terrain to limit cyberdemons firing effectiveness. Day Seven. Effort to maximize 3d effects of doom space. Several footballfields big terrain with four different sets of passages and chambers at different levels crossing each other. Lost souls have amazing freedom of movement due to vertical shafts. Textures used on elevation 2 so gross messed my stomach. Nasty tough vision of industrial hell. Weapons used, everything, but especially the chaingun. Day eight, finished day seven. I don't know if I will ever write another wad. This was fun but exhausting. I tried logging on to the bbs listed in waded but couldn't. Oh, well. The six days have been combined using wadmerge into one episode of six missions for doom1.

But open spaces are also provided for those all out battles. Most heavy firepower is heavily guarded by monsters or hidden. The only easy weapon to get in single player mode is the shotgun. All the weapons are present. This level is mostly hack, slash, ambush + puzzle type. For more information consult the other .txt files in this archive. There now go kill something...

Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think once you get inside, you'll find that CROSSING ACHERON has been fully optimized for DEATHMATCH. But it's just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in Single-player and Co\u00f6perative modes.\r\n\r\nCROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is a sequel to DANTE'S GATE -- thematically, anyway. (It's an E1M3 only because I thought the music was more appropriate than M2.) For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only \"Inferno\" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so na\u00efve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of \"Inferno\" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.\r\n\r\n(By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically). But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)\r\n\r\nI thank those of you who sent me mail on my previous effort, and I hope to hear from more of you about this one.

The top, tech-level floor has the big-mommas. So the flow of battle is upward. It tends to be a pretty fast-paced kill- fest. There are plenty of places to commit suicide, for those so inclined 8^) Note that there are 2 exits to this level. Note also that this level is a secret level. The first exit is the normal exit. The hidden exit (nearby) brings you back to this same secret level. So it is possible to loop this level. This makes it easy to play to a certain number of kills.

You'll find a couple of references to Scream.Wad - so if you've played that, it might help. Then again it might not. As usual, this *can* be done without cheating. * Barrel2 is an updated version of the original WAD. I have changed a few small things and fixed a playability bug in \"Hurt me plenty\".
