I thought this was so cool, and made about seven maps for it. Then I thought to myself \"why not make my own episode of the things?\" Nine maps with less than 100 lines each, hence '900 Deep in the Dead'. This is quite the experimental wad. As such, many of the levels are shorter than you'd usually expect, more linear and without the kind of elaborately-crafted ambushes we know and love. Nonetheless, I hope there's something here you can enjoy. :)", "credits": "Id Software for Doom", "base": "New Levels", "editor_used": "Between two and four hours per map.", "bugs": "None known.", "rating_value": "3.6", "rating_count": "27", "page_visits": "UserPageVisits:54", "downloads": "UserDownloads:43", "creation_date": "2013-07-28", "file_url": "https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/17287-900-deep-in-the-dead/?do=download&csrfKey=93ab09f8fdaf99d963f2db9ea3f0867e", "game": "Doom", "category": ["0-9", "https://www.doomworld.com/files/category/65-0-9/", []], "path": "./database/doom/0-9/900deep.zip", "name": "900deep.zip"}, {"title": "LOSTTOMB (The Discovery) v. 1.2 ", "author": "Barry L.
