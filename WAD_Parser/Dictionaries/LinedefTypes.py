"""
This file contains the internal representation for each linedef type.
!!!! UNLIKE ThingsType, THIS FILE DOES NOT ENCODE DIRECTLY THE MAP PIXEL COLOR, IT SPECIFY AN INTERMEDIATE CODING FOR
RECOGNIZING WHAT IS A LOCAL DOOR, WHAT IS A SWITCH, ETC. !!!!

Final Encoding:
VALUE   CATEGORY
10	    local_doors	    Blue key local door
12	    local_doors	    Red key local door
14	    local_doors	    Yellow key local door
16	    local_doors	    Local door
32+i	remote_doors	Remote door with tag i
64+i	lifts, stairs.. Lifts, Stairs, etc. with tag i
128+i	switch	        Linedef that activates the i tag
192+i	teleports	    teleport to sector i
255	    exit	        Level Exit

Switches does not exist as an explicit linedef type. They are instead all linedefs that have a non-zero "trigger" field.
Local doors are instead directly defined in their linedef type since they are not referenced by anything else.

Refer to WADFeatureExtractor for the complete encoding processing
