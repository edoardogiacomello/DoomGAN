You had singlehanded cleared earth of every scum-blood-dirt sucking alien bastard ever to hit the face of the univers. Or so you thought. As you had probably realised as you were fighting your way through halls, corri- dors and entire cities of hell and horror these alien reptiles had a rather advan- ced technology. And so years before we were ever going to invent time travel they had all ready done it. The few places you did not strike them they used their short time in making time travel experiments. And now they want your head on a stick for being too damn superior. Blasting three rockets into the superbrain almost took your last efforts, but still you had the strenght to drag yourself to a teleporter, adjust your wrist communica- tor to the exact coordinates of the UAC headquarters, or what was left of it, and beam home. Meanwhile those alien arschlocks were con- ducting experiments with their timemachine in order to trap you and beam you back in time to their planet. Right into a play- field of horror and death and humiliation. You would never stand a chance and they would all laugh and spit on you as you would fall to the ground dead! But their machine caught it wrong and send you outside the playfield and into the middle of their smelly bloodinfested world of hate. Here is the chance to prevent all the horror. Kill them now or earth will be for ever doomed. Continue your mission in this totally dif- ferent sequel. This time you move up into the open spaces and you must now not only locate the keys but also some telepoters which will throw you around a bit.

Some trivia: The last map (06) was first finished 2010 for Plutonia Revisited, but was omitted from the project so I released it seperately. The other two are new maps. Note that these maps are placed as map04-06, and not 01-03.

I have worked during the last weeks to give you the improved version I promissed you. And if you were disapointed with the first one (I\u00b4m sure you were), try this one and you will inmediately note the GREAT DIFFERENCE. First, I have to say that not all the things in this WADs were done by me, so I have to give credits to the following persons: *Steve McCrea, Simon Wall, & Elias Papavassilopoulos (sm@eng.cam.ac.uk) for some textures borrowed from TRINITY.WAD *Norman Scott/Tim Scott (norman.scott@flatland.com / tscott@plains.nodak.edu) for the sprites borrowed from their R2wolf.zip *Olivier Montanuy ( montanuy@dmi.ens.fr ) for the great pine borrowed from SWGFX4.zip * The creators of Wolfenstein * The creators of Doom * The creators of WinTex * The creators of Deu2 * The creators of Doom Cad * Bill Neisius for his audio and graphic editors for both Doom and Wolfenstein Now, here comes the description of what I have done: In the Santa Rosa 8 WAD, you can know by yourself how is my house here in Metepec, Mexico. I put any single detail of my house in this new Level including those archs in my garage (I hope you like them). I even added and changed some textures sprites to give my WAD the real appearence of my house. I changed some sprites such as the Medikit, the Compumap, the trees and the columns. And for some nostalgic remembrance, I placed some of the stuff from Wolfstein3D. You won't be disapointed with the new sounds I added. I recorded them from a popular Video Game of an earth worm in a powerful suit.In addition to all this, I improved the level, repairing all those stupid bugs and adding more and better distributed enemies and weapons, more locked doors, better shaded zones, a new city sky, improved textures and more. I have to warn you that before you play this WADs, you have to run INSTALL.BAT, to complete the sprites and flats. Just copy the files (including deusf.exe) to your DOOM ][ directory and run Install.
