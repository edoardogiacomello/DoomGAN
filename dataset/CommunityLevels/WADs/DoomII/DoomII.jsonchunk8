Since your trip back home from this\r\ntorture, you sit with your Rotisserie Gold chicken and Bon-Bons to see\r\nwhat terrific buys the Home Shopping Club has. You turn on your TV,\r\nand to your disappointment, all you see and hear is static. You flip \r\nthrough all the channels, but nothing comes in. You then called the \r\ncable company to see if anything is wrong, but, the phone seems to be \r\ndead. \"This is too weird\", you say to yourself. You then got dressed \r\nin your classy black tank-top and stained shorts to go down to City \r\nHall to see if they have any insight on what was happening. So you \r\nwalk out of your apartment complex, and head to the safe N.Y.C. subway\r\nsystem to go there.\r\n   After waiting 10 minutes for a train, you get on and sit next to a \r\nweird-looking fellow, and one of NYPD's finest, a drunk cop. As the\r\ntrain is about to make it's next stop, the power goes out! Once that\r\nhappened, the weird person attacked everyone in sight. The easiest \r\nprey for him was the cop. He then claws at you with his sharp claws.\r\n  This beast clings onto you like spaghetti sauce on light clothing, \r\nand smashes out the subway doors. As he took you down the tunnel, \r\nletting you walk on the 3rd rail, You saw a blasted out portion of the\r\ntunnel ahead. In this hole, was a teleporter. The beast removed his \r\nclothing to reveal his true identity. He was a CYBER-DEMON! \"I am SICK\r\nof how you treat us when you're around\" Cyber said: \"Now you are going\r\nto pay the ULTIMATE price for your actions! This teleport takes you to\r\nto a retreat for Cyber-Demons, called Euthanasia.\" As he talks, you \r\ntry to get out of his grasp, but he clenches you harder. \"Euthanasia \r\nis a \"funhouse\" for disgruntled Cyber-Demons that want to kill Space \r\nMarines with a rocket blast that will kill people like you, being such\r\na blast, you may not feel the pain, or scream from it. Now, YOU'RE our\r\nnew prey.\" He then throws you into the teleport into Euthanasia, and \r\nall I can say is, Are you feeling MIGHTY LUCKY? You better, or else!", "bugs": "(1) There is a bug in the DooM engine that will screw up the status\r\nbar in spots where the WEAPON NUMBERS are.

Or if you do, don't be surprised at what happens. Standing around is NOT (repeat NOT) recommended. For the rest of you, there's a lot of \"openness\" in this PWAD which lets (overly) curious beach balls float around, and there are a few invisible critters outside the castle to add a little bit of variety. Don't panic. Pay no attention to the noises you think you hear. I can assure you that the castle and its surrounding grounds are perfectly safe... :-) Also, this level was workable (if a bit slow) on my old 486DX/33 and and really plays smoothly on my new DX4/100 and on a Pentium/90, but it might be far too slow on 386 machines due to the largish amount of critter \"activity\" going on.

It was extensively tested by yours truly to insure that only the most skilled and determined players would finish it without cheats. Hint: every time you do something good--SAVE IT!! The opening sequence is particu- larly challenging. You have a pistol and are surrounded by six imps. The following is an explanation of how to do this part: Strafe and go thru the door straight ahead. Hug the left corridor wall and kill the first shotgunner. Hard left up the stairs, taking his shotgun behind the com- puter bank. Kill the chaingunner and get ready for a revenant who's already enroute. Play tag with the revenant for a while and... with a bit of luck, you just might survive this first part! The ammo situation improves from here but you gotta be smart and ro- tate weapons. There are five or six false walls in the wad with goodies and monsters behind them. Look for them and monsters coming out of them. There are two archviles in the wad, one cyberdemon and two spider mas- terminds. In the final room, if you are left standing before the exit door, everyone dead...there is a switch in one of the small rooms that opens up the exit door. Keep your eyes open..there are lots of tricks and traps... Any feedback or questions can be sent to me at Honto1@aol.com.

This is my first level totally conceived within the DOOM2 environment... hope you enjoy it! This is not as large a level as my first two, but it is very challenging. The \"floorplan\" is basically a symetric four quadrant design, and as such - easy to get disoriented in. The center (which is where you begin in both single player and multi-player) is a large room divided into 4 areas by an elevated \"cross\" that is actually a lift. Each of the four center sections open into rooms which contain goodies - at a price. Further exploration of the area will find access to keys and surprises ! If you find yourself in the yellow key area, you will HAVE to face the Cyberdemon (my personal favorite) before escaping with the yellow key (the exception being on lower difficulty levels). The yellow key door (off the center room lift) is tricky - beware...you can get in, BUT NOT OUT without the yellow key ! This is where you'll find the BFG and plasma rifle... You CAN exit the level without going into the \"yellow key area\", but, I hope there are no cowardly marines in this outfit !! My advice is to get the blue key first, because if you get to the \"wooden room\" and successfully make the \"jumps\" to get to the blue key door, and DON'T have the blue key - you're screwed. This, however, makes for interesting multiplayer play... One trick for successfully navigating the wooden room - make your way to the two overlook doorways, and time a couple of rockets so that you get the Revenant and Baron shooting at each other. It will save you ammo and is an interesting vantage point for them duking it out! (Check out the demo...) There ARE some secret areas. One, I call the cave - is pretty big, and you can get the chainsaw as well as dead there. Try to find it - I hint at it in the demo. If you like to go for 100% secrets, try to find the \"hidden Revenant\". If you do, he'll surprise YOU !  I had deathmatch in mind with this level. Use the lifts and transporters to set up ambushes. Deathmatch 2.0 will insure plenty of ammo, etc. (I recommend the \"No Monsters\" flag from either the command line or Death Manager shell - much better for Deathmatch, and it runs faster...) I'll not say anymore - now hop to it! ...and save your game often... (The save game bug I got a couple of complaints from in my previous BDS2 - \"The Phantom\" level is not present in this level). As with The Kicker and The Phantom, my best advice is to KEEP MOVING!  * To play \"FourPlay\":  With the BDS3.wad file in the DOOM2 directory type: doom2 -file bds3.wad  Choose a difficulty setting of your choice. If you would like a \"tour\", please help yourself to the demo I've included. I'll show you SOME of the secrets...

The end of the Callisto campaign (see below) should have meant well-earnt retirement for you, marine. Now that the Callisto anomaly has been brought back to earth, someone else can mop up the remains..after all, we now have the measure of the monsters, and are starting to clear them out of most of earth. But there is a problem...one of the spooks at the military academy came up to you in the camp laboratory last night with a bunch of old books and things in a time-stasis case. He said there were quite a few of them in a military store in deepest Iowa (thats right, the one where the Ark of the Covenant is stored) - and told you that this was a CLASS 1 secret. Even the president was never told about these, and up until now, no-one has known how to interpret them. They are in a variety of hands, some ancient (one even seems to be a papyrus scroll with hieroglyphics, although the spook will only mutter darkly about plagues and darknesses when you ask about it) and some more modern. The upshot of it is that all describe foul beings that have haunted some troubled spots of earth. The spook produces a marbled edged ledger, its pages spotted with blood, and edges burnt. You read the copperplate with a sinking feeling.. \"The ledger of William Jago, butcher, at the sign of the Red Deaths Head, Solomons End, Whitechapel, London, in the year 1858...I know the things were out in the alleyways in Whitechapel again last night..I know it is not a dream, and I saw the two watch men all burnt up by the fire from the evil brown things hands..all the people hid behind their doorways, and even the night-walkers fled..there was a great beast of some kind that made a blasphemous noise in which I could hear no words spoken..noises as of engines came from the site where the new buildings are to be made by Cut-Throat Alley..I heard terrible deep laughter, vile laughter..some arch-fiend is hiding in the alleyways, and I fear for my soul..\" \"All we know, Blazkowicz, is that Jago and his shop and all the area around it were destroyed in a huge fire, and they never recovered any bodies\" says the spook \"but theres a problem... the British government psychics say that the bastards have come back twice..once during the 1880s and again during the first world war... at least one of the Jack the Ripper sightings was of a brown thing the size of a man with thorns growing from its legs and arms, and fire around it..they put the man who reported it in Bedlam, but we think we know the truth now...and they say that the problem may emerge again..soon\" The spook tells you about the experiments with the Callisto anomaly, and the attempts to use it to see the heart of Victorian London.  \"Unfortunately, we lost a few men attempting to get through, Blazkowicz...keep an eye out for them, some may be rescuable..We think that most of the ammunition and stores we sent through has reached the target area, but we aren't sure.. we are not even sure if we can bring you home.. keep a sharp eye for anything that looks like a switch..if the creatures are there, it'll be heavily guarded.\"  \"Some of our people have a theory that the Callisto anomaly will transport you to the nearest brood of the hellspawn..the nearest to here is London 1858, but there may not be a way straight back. There's another..well, that can wait! It looks like your tour of duty, marine..if you don't make it straight back, read the update on your belt computer - it's updated automatically, and it should give you some idea of what you're up against..good luck!\" You strap on your military revolver, walk up to the Anomaly Lab. \"OK, lets rock..\" and you step into the machine.

With more marines at your disposal, you all go off to a vessel that was recently repaired, in hopes of making it off the moon base in one piece. In mid-flight, the vessel goes haywire, and the captain attempts an emergency landing on a nearby celestial body. As the vessel hits, it disintegrates and many of you are killed. You sustain a minor concussion, lucky you... As you recover, you gaze into the distance.
