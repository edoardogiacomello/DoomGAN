You can barely make out what the operator is saying, so you press your finger against your earpiece, hoping to at least capture some of what he's saying. The man's voice sounds a bit frantic.

Ending: This is DOOM, but hey, let's provide an ending story: Upon discovering the portal that the inhabitants of hell used to invade the local mall, you decide to seal it off. You can only hold these demons back for so long. Plus, backup should've arrived by now. As you wait for what seems like an eternity, you decide that it's time to take matters into your own hands. You reach for your lucky grenade and toss it into the portal, destroying it. Hopefully that should do it.

One of the most remarkable sites of these ruins was the mile high crusher, which had amazingly pinched a whole between both dimensions.\r\n\r\nUAC did the impossible to cover up their sinister operation. From outside the site seames to be and abandoned brick structure...but from the inside, its a completely different story . A duke had discovered these ruins in the 12th century and built his castle around them, including a precious library with countless volumes on witchcraft. But now UAC has taken over and integrated this castle to thier research facilities.\r\n\r\nIt was recorded in the computer logs that the researchers were able to open the portal for a few moments, but it was too unstable. A few days later, after this grand moment, demons began to appear everywhere. \r\n\r\nLittle by little the researchers of this ultra-secret operation became possesed by confusion and rage, rendering themselves useless to their tasks. Somehow UAC forsaw that the doom of the world was inminent and decided to give it one last shot. They hire the one last man on earth who had any experience with these types of operations (you), and hoped for the impossible.\r\n\r\nLEVEL CONSTRUCTION: It took a WHOOOOOOLE YEAR to create this level (I am not kidding!).But it wasn't a 24-hour a day kind of thing,but more of a \"30 minutes here\"-\"30 minutes there\" thing. I had a small deathmatch level planned out when I first started... but, as time went by, it got soooooo big I just had to convert it into a one player type of level (although I think deathmatch and COop is DOable,I have never really tried it). I tried to pay attention to the texture alignments, aswell as the shadow effects of certain light sources.

Origionally I had intended the level to use the sky texture in the first episode of DOOM1\u00a9... but I have been told it is illegal to distribute it in WADS...so I substituted in my own. If you have the opportunity (and the patience of installing it) use the DOOM1 sky texture. It best fits the mood of the level.\r\n\r\n(*note: What follows are fixed bugs...I hope that if you experience similar problems with your level... it might help you...*)\r\n\r\nA bug I encountered was one which resulted with DOOM2 crashing and displaying the message \"visible plane overflow\". What happenes is that I placed 8 sectors around various lamps to simulate lighting. Whenever a player stood viewing two of these lamps in a straight line... DOOM2 would crash. I fixed this bug by inserting a sector between any two \"lamp sectors\" , thus obstructing the direct view of +16 sectors which could cause DOOM2 to crash.\r\n\r\nIf your DOOM level crashes while saving it is most likely due to the fact that there are too many THINGS in the level.

", "author": "Joseph J. Pecoraro", "description": "This DOOM2, level 1 PWAD is the net result of playing and studying dozens of other levels. I incorporated all my favorite tricks and traps into this one, three key level. WAOTD.WAD is designed as a mini-game, taking you from pistol to BFG 9000. All the bad guys are here as well as just enough power-ups and ammo to get you through the level. One of the frustrating aspects of this level is that each goal -- ending, keys, etc. are in plain sight -- but you have to deduce how to \"get there from here\" while fighting off the strategically place enemies. You need to be observant as well as vigilant, and there is a maze problem that will challenge you too. I have included a demo file, HOW2.LMP, that shows the entire level played without cheating. It took me over 17 minutes to make it, and I know all the tricks! To view it be sure that WAOTD.WAD and HOW2.LMP are both unzipped into your DOOM2 sub-directory. Then use the following DOS command: doom2 -file WAOTD.WAD -playdemo how2 This level should provide you with many hours of intense action! Additional Credits to My kids, Megan, Joe, Mike and Steven who put in a lot of test-play time and helped me root out the bugs. I think we got them all. I will say that most of the \"bugs\" turned out to be problems with the DoomCad node builder, because after processing the wad with WARM 1.3 they disappeared.", "credits": "My kids, Megan, Joe, Mike and Steven who put in a lot of test-play time and helped me root out the bugs.
