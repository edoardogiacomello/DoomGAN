George Fiffy,"Not too long ago, you. B.J. Blazcowictz found out where Satan lived when
you were wondering through Hell. As he was preparing his troops for Hell On 
Earth, he left his home, and wreaked havoc on Earth. You then went to his   
castle (FIFFY2.WAD) and got even! When he returned home a few months later,
he was FURIOUS! Satan got so angry, he built a special school called Satan's
School of Warfare (WAR4.WAD). On his day off, you went in and slaughtered   
the student body, as well as all of his staff. What you didn't know about   
this school was that the students were being trained to go to your New York 
penthouse apartment on your break and destroy you like never before! Good   
thing you were there early! Just think, if you didn't go there, you would be
DEAD now! No wife, no children (Hmmm), and worst of all, NO 90210! (Running 
gag. Was in another doc to another level.) You DO want to see the one where 
Brandon's girlfriends take him to Bob Barker to get... Well, you get the    
picture! :)                                                                 
   You hear the phone ring, and you hesitantly answer it. Colonel Sanders is
on the line. Oh boy, just what you need on your day off watching the O.J.   
SIMPSON TRIAL! Sanders told you that Lucifer himself just bought his second
home in Hell because you wrecked the first one. You shrug your sholders as  
the TV cameramen accidently show the face of a juror. Sanders then told you 
that Satan is going to pay you a visit. You then wake your family, pack, and
go to MOTEL 6 to hide your family, as you go off to meet your fate, while   
your family watches TV with 46 channels, all but 5 carrying the O.J. SIMPSON
TRIAL (That gives you more reasons to play DOOM, doesn't it?). You head to  
a starirway that goes to Hell and find Satan nowhere, but you do find his   
new home in Hell. Since you reflect back and remember that your family is   
now safe in a motel, you decide to take the $.50 tour of his home, and do   
what you've done last time, kick butt, and go on a rampage! You'll meet his 
bodyguard at the end, so don't say you were not warned! This is the time to 
get out your weponry and ask: ""Who wants to be fried?"" You go in, and you   
fight for your life, and to free the world from havoc (for now).",,,,"(1) That toe you stubbed this morning. That's why God gave us toes, to find

George Fiffy,"It was a nice, sunny day on the moon of Phobos. You decide to
take a nature walk around the terrain, when you come across a weird (yet
interesting) structure about two miles away. Since you walk the same route
practically every day, you swore that that building was not there before.
You decide to trailblaze (in the treeless plains, don't get lost!) towards
this structure.
        You are almost there. You decide to stop for a moment and look at
the building, stretching across the hill it was sitting on, and you say
to yourself: ""That sucker is HUGE!""
        You walk closer towards the structure, and you can finally see
some detail on the structure. ""Something just does not seem right"" you say
to yourself. You get an eerie feeling in your stomach, but after puking
you brains out on that bottled Mexican water you drank an hour ago, you
still press onwards, towards the ominous superstructure.
        You are getting very close now. You can read a sign up ahead.
About 1/4 mile from the building, the sign reads ""Enter at your own risk"".
You heard noises coming from the structure, but as you step onto a dry
twig, all the noise in that direction came to a halt. You must have fig-
ured that it was the U.S. Government still trying to hide some top secret
space craft like some morons in the desert who think you do not know what
they are hiding. You decide to start running towards the superstructure,
and you are very close. Suddenly, something weird happens.
        A green puff of smoke appears all around you, accompanied by a
metallic sound. Once the noise and green smog around you diminished, you
realized you were teleported INSIDE the secret structure, and now you are
inside the ""forbidden teritory"" of Hell's new tenement for all the bad
boys from Hell, The Barrons, the Cacodaemons, and, well, more Barrons!
Too many Barrons! Of course, a few weaklings are here as well (how did
they get to work in here?).

you. All I can say is, GO GET 'EM!",,,,"(1) TRAPPED ON STAIRWELL: The stairwell in front of you, when you start,

George Fiffy,"It's Sunday morning, at least to your knowledge, and Satan is STILL
creating havoc on Earth! For now, you have another mission to accomplish!
   It's now Christmas Eve in the year 2194, and most of hell's creatures
usually go to church for a sermon of evil, and for a good night's sleep.
(Like real church, there will USUALLY be far more vacant pews than the
day of Christmas, or Easter.)
   You're heading back to Earth to see what's happening up there, when
you come across a church that does not exactly preach about God, but the
evil one, SATAN!
   Well, you decide to head into the church to see what this twisted
satanic religion is like, but as usual, you are not greeted quite too
well for interrupting the sermon. You work your way into the back area of
the building to find daemons galore on your tail. Once you reach the back
exit of the church, a door out of nowhere (literally) opens up right out
of the sky! You then realize that there is an invisible building on site!
You then realize that your adventure isn't really over, but has only JUST
BEGUN!",,,,"(1) HALL OF MIRRORS BIG-TIME! (SOB!): When you open the door to the
    church, depending on where you stand, you will experience the dreaded
    HOM EFFECT. This is because (now I REALLY know why) there are WAY TOO
    MANY linedefs (not sectors) on screen at once. Too much detail for
    the darn game to draw! This happens when you stand on the altar
    as well. I think there's a 100 linedef limit, according to sources.

    the brick retainer wall, on the church side overlooking the lower
    courtyard, you'll notice a corner of the brick wall that is
    ""missing"". However, on the other side of this wall (a good 30 feet
    lower than this viewpoint), this corner IS visible. I guess the
    ""engine"" of this program has a couple bugs that ID SOFTWARE did not
    know about (they didn't attempt anything difficult like this)!

(3) ENEMIES SEE THROUGH STAINED GLASS WINDOWS: If you're outside the
    church, looking at the far end of the building, enemies inside the
    church will come out after you. If you look at this level with an

George Fiffy,"It's the year 2094, and after all of hell's daemons that returned to the
Mt. McKinley Base (FIFFY.WAD: REoL TOUGH: Hell On Earth), found it all
boarded up. They all broke in, and were sent to the new Detention Center
located next to it.
   Most of the daemons were just awaiting for Satan to start the new school
year at SATAN'S SCHOOL OF WARFARE (next REoL TOUGH level. Look for it soon)
for classes. They just wanted to go back to hell, but the access way was
closed, and they just simply wanted to go back!
   One day, HELL BROKE LOOSE! A riot broke out in the Detention Camp (and a
fairly nice one too)! Some guards were sent in to put as many deamons as
they can into 10 prison cells located in the building, 2 in one cell block,
8 in the other. All could fit 4 comfortably. Some daemons were too big for
that requirement. There were just too many daemons running around!
  All the guards were killed, and the daemons are running all over the
place! A good hiding spot within this Detention Camp is the Unenchanted
Forrest! They are ready for ANYONE who gets in their way!
  Meanwhile, you, B.J. BLAZKOWICZ, was sent to the White House to be
breifed on what's going on atop Mt. McKinley, AGAIN! At first you thought
something horrible was to happen to the President. It's worse! It could
threaten ALL MANKIND, like George Bush did to this country!
  You were given a partial map of the Detention Center, and you were told
in a briefing by the Pentagon that you'll have to use a room called The
Pit to gain access to all parts of the building. To keep evil ones from
escaping, switches throughout the building (sometimes tripwires) are used
to activate/deactivate lifts to gain entry to doors in The Pit. All were
lowered at night. It's reported the Daemons have lowered all the platforms
and filled the pit with 10 feet of radioactive waste! You'll have to find
the switches or trip wires to raise the lifts to other doors so as not to
get the goo all over you, AND to be able to reach the doors as well!
NOTE: ONE door will NOT have a platform for it in The Pit! This door is an
""exit only"" door to exit the Unenchanted Forrest. BEWARE!
  GOOD LUCK! YOU MAY NEED IT!",,,,"* SHOOT THROUGH IMPASSABLE WALLS: The first part of your journey starts in
  a room that goes dark, and a platform lowers. The big brown area is a
  room that holds the important yellow key. When daemons with fire power
  are in this room, they (and you) can shoot through the walls of this
  room! This is a bad engineering flaw in the design of this room. DAMN!
* LIGHTS OUT AGAIN?: This same area. The room goes dark (set to trip off
  the lights ONCE), and you open the yellow door, The lights are tripped
  on (set to go on ONCE). Returning back to The Pit, the lights MAY go out
  AGAIN, even though that is NOT suposed to happen!
* DISAPPEARING SPRITES: Comes with the REoL TOUGH territory. Too many
  sprites, several will dissapear. This time, it's all those TREES, and NOT
  a billion enemies in the Unenchanted Forrest (there are a few well-placed
  enemies. KEEP MOVING!). If trees disappear, and you walk and suddenly do
  not move, and nothing's in front of you, there is a tree there.",,2,7,10,15,1994-09-05,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/8617-reol-tough-the-pit/?do=download&csrfKey=6a9cd22966deda36a3f0d54f017bbf5a,Doom,0-9,REoL TOUGH:   The Pit ,1fiffy4.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/1fiffy4_FIFFY4.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/1fiffy4_FIFFY4_E1M5.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/1fiffy4_FIFFY4_E1M5.txt

George Fiffy,"ABOUT THE TOTAL WAR III EXPERIENCE: To play the new level, type REoLDOOM to start total chaos! This is probably one of the weirdest DOOM levels you may ever had played! There are soooo many weird effects and illusions you may have thought would be IMPOSSIBLE to do (if you're a DOOM level maker your- self)! The effects you will see start right in the beginning! A door in the middle of the starting area! You'll also see doors coming out of the sky, dark rooms you can see fine in (it doesn't make sense at all, doesn't it? Well, it was done. You'll be suprised!), and get this, INVISABLE BUILDINGS! You may see the doors (sometimes), and maybe the windows, but you don't see a building attatched! The ""pancake syndrome"" is also cleared up (flat outer retaining walls, and unflattened entry- ways can be seen BEYOND the walls, to show thickness, unlike E3M1). Some ""flatness"" is around, but that's because there are invisable buildings around. Invisable doors leave ""slices"" or voids in the wall, or the top of the wall. One neat DOOM effect is the Hall Of Mirrors. One room has this effect in it's windows. This is NO screw-up. It's done on PURPOSE! The ""teleporting theory"" found in the real E3M7 is also in here, but with a different twist. All I'm going to say is that it's harder to do (heh, heh, heh!). Also, be carefull of a few nasty areas! There are five areas where you'll be fighting very hard! You won't be fighting as hard as in TOTAL WAR II, E1M2, but it's quite a nasty brawl!

MULTI-PLAYER: This is an adventure for up to four of your friends. Each can grab a shotgun and a backpack at the start, so don't be greedy!

DEATHMATCH: You'll start off with a shotgun, shells, and an energy pack next to you. Why the energy pack? SOMEWHERE (not in a secret area) in this world is a BFG9000! Two of you will be very close!

It's only a small band. This is NOT suposed to happen! No big deal! * A switch that suposed to open an invisable door and keep it open is somehow shut on occasion by the enemies you face. I fixed this by making it's switch retriggerable, in case it happens again. * Got a PENTIUM? If not, it's alright, if you have a high speed 486 at 33MHz or greater (my 486 is a 20.

the end of hell's reign of terror! You then go back home to your wife

   While watching Wheel Of Fortune, right when you think you solved
the puzzle, a special report interupts your programming. You change
the channels, but ALL the stations are airing a report on something
horrible happening near the top of Mount McKenley. Daemons from hell
are building a main HQ building to try and take over the earth! This
gets you very angry, after all, you thought you solved the puzzle on
Wheel Of Fortune!

teach those ingrates a lesson before things get out of hand.
   You arrive to the base from Hell atop Mt. McKenly. It's a big
metal building filled to the rim with hell's creatures. You walk in
and find you are too late. Hell already started throwing Earth into
total chaos, but YOU can reduce the effect! 
   Reports state that 24 hours ago they started sending daemons out
into the world, through a special EXIT switch scattering these
bastards all over the plannet. You trip an infared beam, and the
creatures re-wire the switch to only bring you to E1M2, and all 
enemies are on full allert to search and destroy you! Most of them
are hiding secretly throughout the building waiting for you! You never
knew anything about their technology anyway, so you're objective is
not to fix the switch, but to clear the ""metal halls of hell"" so
no more creatures will wreak havoc on Earth. After all, if all are
dead, no one can fix the switch, and no one can transport them-
selves to the four corners of the globe!

become a force too great for all armies to face.",,,,"I did fix the ""nice"" monster problem, by using a separate BSP

Eric Severn,"""An enemy spaceship has approached our planet and is now in a low orbit. We beamed a squad of soldiers aboard in the hopes that they could somehow subtly sabotage and destroy it, but we've lost contact with them. In their last transmission, they indicated that they were trying to get to the helm on the bridge and slow the ship enough that it drops out of orbit and burns up in the atmosphere. The ship now has its deflectors up and beaming aboard is no longer an option, however, the ship's deflectors do not interfere with it's own beaming device, nor with non-light-energy based weapons. So now, the only way we can break into the ship is with brute force.

Agtronic,"This is an early style ""tech base"" map for DOOM 1, made in 2015. It was meticulously detailed and should be aesthetically pleasing to those who are not sick of the tech base theme. Think of it as a nostalgic ode to the early DOOM experience.

A little history: I was 13 when I first played DOOM. The level of engagement (and fear) that I felt when I first played it on a 386 with a PC speaker is something I have not felt since those days in any modern game. I guess our imagination was more developed back then. I was absolutely blown away by the detail and realism I saw when walking through the creepy halls of the various military bases. 

When I first heard that people were creating their own maps in 1994, I was intrigued and fascinated by what I thought was an impossibly complicated process. I experimented with mapping back then using Doom Editor - The Real Thing by Geoff Allan, in Windows 3.1. It crashed all the time. I also found it difficult to convert my ideas into an actual map. I gave up after loosing my progress a few too many times. 

Fast-forward 20 years to 2013, and I stumbled across a website for Doom Builder 2. I was shocked to find out that there was a map editor for Doom, and that it was developed in the 2000s. Since I was not a gamer and rarely played video games at all (except for a short stint of obsession with GTA4), I thought Doom modding died a long time ago. I downloaded the map editor and started to experiment. I was amazed at how rock solid Doom Builder was. (To this day, it has not crashed a single time, nor have I ever noticed a single bug.)

It was on. I started to map out a few ideas and quickly became obsessed. It was so easy to draw out exactly what I was thinking, and the 3D mode was blowing my mind. I started to work on an E1 episode like I had always wanted to since the 90s. 

This level is the 2nd map of the episode. It is also the 2nd map I make (ever). The first is complete, and the 3rd is half done. I liked how this one turned out. Halfway through the development of this map, I discovered the PWAD archive and the Doom World forum. I had NO IDEA there was still a huge community of Doom playing and modding. I started to download some maps. When I saw how far mapping has come, I was reluctant to release this. My map comes from someone who last played doom in the 90s so it really was styled to what I thought was the ultimate style. But I still really like the tech base style and figured some people might enjoy it.

John W. Anderson (aka Dr. Sleep),"This is CROSSING ACHERON for DOOM v. 1.666. I have updated some textures, added new monsters, and completely revamped and added whole new areas. This is the level as I originally intended it, and I hope that you enjoy it. As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think the level is just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in DEATHMATCH as in Single-player and Coöperative modes. CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is part of a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only ""Inferno"" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so naïve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of ""Inferno"" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded. (By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically). But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it several different ways and just wasn't convinced.) Thanks. Hope you like it.","Raphaël Quinet and Brendon J.

Grimm,"(For story see comp-ful.txt) Type complex to begin. The DeHackEd patch changes the level names under the map. Enigmatic Complex is a large wad (it jams up DEU 5.21 and BSP 1.2) that largely takes place inside a, suprise, large complex. It is the first level of a new Doom. It takes me around twenty minutes to complete with 100% on everything, so it will probably take you a little longer. The dificulty goes from easy to hard. In UV you should be able to make it through the fighting without too much trouble, but there are some hairy moments that will probably kill you when you first run across them. The ""marble"" area has 155 monsters. There was originally going to be a lot more to this level (like bathrooms, a mess hall, and secruity cameras), but I ran out of memory.

Helioth,"This mornig your boss was in a bad mood: the coffee vending machine is out of order. That's the reason why you find yourself at the entrance of the C.R.R.G.E. (Center for Research on Regressive Genetical Experiments). Bad luck. This building was abandonned and closed some years ago because of an experiment that has gone wrong. All that we know is that this building is full of 'half-intelligent' and bellicous genetical monsters. Woah, and your boss has sent you in there with a little ridiculous gun... 'Try not to waste the ammunitions!', he said before you entered. Ha! A bullet in his head! That's all what your boss should earn...

But if you want to shoot one in his head, you'll have to come alive out of this building: your lovely boss did solder the door behind you... Through the door you just heared an ugly voice screaming 'Good luck!', immediately follewed by the 'PoP!' of a champagne cork...

Valentin Albillo,"I'm truly fond of Doom, since its original release a number of years ago to this date (03/98), despite the brand new, all bells- and-whistles 3D games like Duke Nukem, Quake, Quake II, Heretic, Hexen, Hexen II, Rise of The Triad, Dark Forces, Tomb Raider, Exhumed, Shadow Warrior, Blood, etc, etc, etc.  After playing hundreds (literally) of the very best Doom/Doom II levels, I decided to try my hand at writing my own, and here you have it: this original Doom (not Doom II) level is the result. Main features: - VERY large level, guaranteed to be one of the largest Doom levels you'll ever find. More than 400k for a single level, WITHOUT using any gimmick extras. - intended to be fun, not extremely difficult. This is no ""Plutonia Experiment"" only suitable for some Doom Gods. Try and find the correct skill level for you, there's one for sure. - optimized for speed: it includes a built-in REJECT resource with a 94% efficiency, for the fastest possible gameplay. - absolutely NO bugs: no HOM's, Medusa effects, tutti-frutti, tall walls, nothing. It's been thoroughly tested and it's bug-free. Besides, despite its size, you CAN save the game at any moment, it will not overflow the savegame buffer, as it happens with other large levels. - truly non-linear geometrically: there are many distinct, interconnected paths through the level. - truly non-linear strategically: there are several different ways to kill most of the big bosses. - extreme attention paid to detail: all textures aligned, lighting, illumination effects, aesthetically pleasing architecture and color combinations, etc - single player, cooperative (4 starts) and deathmatch (4 starts), plus all difficulty levels implemented: from a difficulty ratio of 0.605 at ""I'm too young to die"" (skill 1) to 1.476 at ""Ultra-violence"" (skill 4) - hundreds of enemies (more than 220) of all types for you to defeat, without being a continuous, brainless massacre: you'll have to stop and think a little from time to time. - all weapons included, all items, all power-ups, all keys are used and necessary to exit. - no dead-ends, all secret doors marked somehow, no obscure puzzles to ruin the fun, but expect pits, traps and some *very* nasty ambushes. - a complete test of your Doom abilities: you'll need speed, accuracy, reflexes, smarts, and at some places, a lot of balance, patience, and luck. - it *doesn't* include anything not found in the original Doom: new sounds, textures, dehack patches, special effects, etc. It tries to excel by its architecture, aesthetics, theme, and playability alone, using just original Doom elements, like >id< did in the first place. - and finally, it's a theme level. The theme is as follows:  ""At my early stages of Doom-playing, the most feared enemy was the Cyberdemon. I always found it very difficult to deal with it, and it took me quite a lot of time to defeat the first one. Then I began to think in how many possible ways could a Cyberdemon be killed. Of course, you could always kill it by brute force, in the open (say with a BFG-9000 or so), but after chewing it a while, I discovered several other interesting ways ..."" That's the theme of this level. You'll enter the Cyberdemon's Realm. It's a huge, magnificent fortress, heavily guarded by hundreds of lesser monsters, where the Cyberdemon Kings rule. Your mission is to exterminate every one of them, and exit the fortress alive. You'll have to decide your strategy individually for each of the Cyberdemon Kings. Some you could try to kill using a powerful weapon. Some you could lead to a devious trap. Some you could turn their subdit monsters against them. Some you could fire at from a suitable shelter ... As you'll see, there is *more than one way* to kill them. It's up to you to decide how, and make the necessary arrangements. And be careful with your ammo. At the higher difficulty levels, you will have to think before shooting, or else risk being defenceless in the Realm ...

Stephen Huff,"The bad news is you are in hell. The good news is you have a chainsaw that never runs out of gasoline. Your problem to cut your way through hell until you find a way out. Sounds like the leadin to a TV show doesn't it. Each week watch as out intrepid space marines cut their way through another part of hell. Seeking the exit that will eventually get them out. In order to get character interaction. You do it in coop mode. Have the guys at ID software do the voices of the players with faces animated against standard doom textures. Record the action scenes from the doom wad as it is played in coop mode by three to four players. Cut between animation of conversation and the action as scene by the players to make the final cut of the show. Do a different wad each week. You could make it in your home on a strong pc with a really good interface board. Invite military people to design wads that illustrate small group tactics and weapons choice based on enemy and terrain. Invite ministers to write sermons based on the faults and vices of demons and how terrible a place hell is, and you could get both the militia, 2nd amendment people and Christian fundamentalists to tune in every week. Include a magazine sub, with a monthly disk containing the wads to be played in upcoming shows of the series, so the watchers can play through first and then compare their method of taking the wad to the one on the show when it comes up. Talk about your interactive tv. Wow, you come up with some strange ideas when you are bored. OK. I decided to write some wad files because I was bored. Day one. Trying to follow the lessons in secrets of the doom programming gurus step by step. NOGO. So, I stopped at lesson one and spent the entire day practicing drawing singleroom sectors. No changes in elevation, no doors, no lifts. The only special linetype in the wad is the exit switch. Play is based on narrow tight terrain with monsters around the corner and in the next room. The chainsaw is the weapon of choice in this terrain. Use it. Day two, still practicing drawing sectors, this time with changes in floor height and setting sectors inside of sectors. One really big abyss with lots of platforms at different heights. Weapon of choice, the rocket Launcher, try shooting the muzzle flashes of the cacodemons as they shoot at you from the darkness. If they get close enough to see them, they are almost close enough for the explosion from the rocket to hurt you. Move fast shoot hard, and get out. Day three. Practice with special sectors, doors, crushing ceilings, crushing floors, one teleport. Lines that open secret doors. Lots of no humans signs. Weapon of choice, shotgun, chainsaw, rocket launcher, plasma gun. Enjoy. Day four. Waded crashed and wads saved would crash doom. Loaded a wad from wadcat1 and removed everything but one chamber and built on that. This worked. Key weapons chainsaw, shotgun, demon fratricide and crushing ceilings. Also rocket launcher. But watch out. Day five, afraid waded would crash, so built behind the blue door sector of day 4 wad. Pretty blue scenery. Interesting surprise at end. Day six. Starting to get good. Emphasis on chainsaw and infighting. Close tight terrain with enemies coming out of the walls. Must use demon fratricide to make it to exit. Interesting use of terrain to limit cyberdemons firing effectiveness. Day Seven. Effort to maximize 3d effects of doom space. Several footballfields big terrain with four different sets of passages and chambers at different levels crossing each other. Lost souls have amazing freedom of movement due to vertical shafts. Textures used on elevation 2 so gross messed my stomach. Nasty tough vision of industrial hell. Weapons used, everything, but especially the chaingun. Day eight, finished day seven. I don't know if I will ever write another wad. This was fun but exhausting. I tried logging on to the bbs listed in waded but couldn't. Oh, well. The six days have been combined using wadmerge into one episode of six missions for doom1.

Stephen Huff,"The bad news is you are in hell. The good news is you have a chainsaw that never runs out of gasoline. Your problem to cut your way through hell until you find a way out. Sounds like the leadin to a TV show doesn't it. Each week watch as out intrepid space marines cut their way through another part of hell. Seeking the exit that will eventually get them out. In order to get character interaction. You do it in coop mode. Have the guys at ID software do the voices of the players with faces animated against standard doom textures. Record the action scenes from the doom wad as it is played in coop mode by three to four players. Cut between animation of conversation and the action as scene by the players to make the final cut of the show. Do a different wad each week. You could make it in your home on a strong pc with a really good interface board. Invite military people to design wads that illustrate small group tactics and weapons choice based on enemy and terrain. Invite ministers to write sermons based on the faults and vices of demons and how terrible a place hell is, and you could get both the militia, 2nd amendment people and Christian fundamentalists to tune in every week. Include a magazine sub, with a monthly disk containing the wads to be played in upcoming shows of the series, so the watchers can play through first and then compare their method of taking the wad to the one on the show when it comes up. Talk about your interactive tv. Wow, you come up with some strange ideas when you are bored. OK. I decided to write some wad files because I was bored. Day one. Trying to follow the lessons in secrets of the doom programming gurus step by step. NOGO. So, I stopped at lesson one and spent the entire day practicing drawing singleroom sectors. No changes in elevation, no doors, no lifts. The only special linetype in the wad is the exit switch. Play is based on narrow tight terrain with monsters around the corner and in the next room. The chainsaw is the weapon of choice in this terrain. Use it. Day two, still practicing drawing sectors, this time with changes in floor height and setting sectors inside of sectors. One really big abyss with lots of platforms at different heights. Weapon of choice, the rocket Launcher, try shooting the muzzle flashes of the cacodemons as they shoot at you from the darkness. If they get close enough to see them, they are almost close enough for the explosion from the rocket to hurt you. Move fast shoot hard, and get out. Day three. Practice with special sectors, doors, crushing ceilings, crushing floors, one teleport. Lines that open secret doors. Lots of no humans signs. Weapon of choice, shotgun, chainsaw, rocket launcher, plasma gun. Enjoy. Day four. Waded crashed and wads saved would crash doom. Loaded a wad from wadcat1 and removed everything but one chamber and built on that. This worked. Key weapons chainsaw, shotgun, demon fratricide and crushing ceilings. Also rocket launcher. But watch out. Day five, afraid waded would crash, so built behind the blue door sector of day 4 wad. Pretty blue scenery. Interesting surprise at end. Day six. Starting to get good. Emphasis on chainsaw and infighting. Close tight terrain with enemies coming out of the walls. Must use demon fratricide to make it to exit. Interesting use of terrain to limit cyberdemons firing effectiveness. Day Seven. Effort to maximize 3d effects of doom space. Several footballfields big terrain with four different sets of passages and chambers at different levels crossing each other. Lost souls have amazing freedom of movement due to vertical shafts. Textures used on elevation 2 so gross messed my stomach. Nasty tough vision of industrial hell. Weapons used, everything, but especially the chaingun. Day eight, finished day seven. I don't know if I will ever write another wad. This was fun but exhausting. I tried logging on to the bbs listed in waded but couldn't. Oh, well.

Steve Johnston,"Single player WAD, not set for deathmatch. Not great for co-op either. Made as slugfest. Save your ammo.

You were about :to turn inward to try to decide if Tatoo and Mr. Rourke's :relationship was a mere working one or somehow something :more, when you realized that the griping of the cadets around :you had a decidedly dark tone to it. That alone was of little :surprise -- after all, they were possessed and all -- but :you'd been in the marines long enough to hear the truth behind :the growling, screeching, pea-soup-spitting words. :The academy had a serious morale problem. :Hope jolted your heart. You could use this knowledge. If only... :That was when your hand touched the smooth barrel of the shotgun. :You grinned evily. Now it was time to pay those bastards back. :You decided as you strode towards the door that, if there were :enough left alive, you'd make them watch ""Starsky and Hutch""... :in German. :With thoughts of Phillip Michael Glasier spouting :""Du!

should run on almost any machine that is capable of running DOOM
(although E2M5 may get slow due to the ENORMOUS number of monsters
on it.  My machine is a 4MB 33MHZ 486 DX, and it runs slow at times 
on that...).  If you like lots of mayhem, and plenty of dying (both you
and the monsters) then these levels are for you.  If you like pretty
artwork, or frustrating puzzles, then find another wad.
(BTW - the levels aren't UGLY - the textures are all aligned and selected
with some care - you actually might really like how some of the levels
look.  But one none of them did I spend more than an hour or two selecting
textures)",,,,,,1,3,11,8,1995-04-03,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/1753-combat_2wad/?do=download&csrfKey=edb6a69b586ae00308a5e0a2c2eabbc1,Doom,a-c,COMBAT_2.WAD ,combat_2.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/combat_2_COMBAT_2.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/combat_2_COMBAT_2_E2M9.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/combat_2_COMBAT_2_E2M9.txt

Mark Mackey,"The year: 1943 The place: Somewhere in the northern Atlantic. The situation: Grim. Alone in the middle of the Atlantic. You knew in your heart that it was the end when the escort, the HMS Marianna, picked up three U- boats on the sonar. The Teela Dan didn't have a chance: the torpedoes split her wide open and she sank within seconds. You were lucky enough to launch one of the liferafts before she went down, but the others who dived overboard all died in agony when the fuel slick went up.  You were hoping that the Marianna got an SOS away before she too went down, but no rescue ships have appeared and your water supply has nearly run out. You are almost resigned to a lonely death on the high seas, when... Wait! Is that.. Yes, it's a ship! An old one, by the looks of it, since it's running under sail. Luckily the breeze is very light, and you manage to paddle the raft into its course. However, nobody on board is responding to your hails. Strange... what's the name of the ship? You squint, and can just make out the name 'Marie Celeste'. The Marie Celeste? Wasn't that the ship that was found mysteriously abandoned years and years ago? What the hell is it doing here? Well, there's only one way to find out!

At easier settings there are fewer monsters, and at harder settings you got more monsters to frag! I haven't forgotten those of you who like to kill your friends (or enemies), of course you can Deathmatch on this level but it's to big to be any fun. Cooperative playing is also implemented. Watch out for QUAKE.WAD on a ftp-site near you soon. This is me and my friends own levels that we use when we get together for deathmatch. It is 6 levels designed to be used as deathmatch with 2-4 players, it's best with 4 players if you like many frags! Also soon QUAKE2.WAD, and HERQUAKE.WAD - this is QUAKE.WAD converted to DOOM 2 and HERETIC. QUAKE2.WAD has an extra level. In the future maybe you will see ALONE2.WAD.

You were to penetrate the computer and  transfer of all of their data into 
the Suckulator 2000 hybrid bio-silicon storage box. You made it deep into 
the city and found a personal study terminal.  Dora hooked up the S2000 to 
her head and the dark one's personal PC and began transferring data.

Matthew G. Hooper,"This is my third and what I think is my best Wad. Plenty of graphics changes as well as a nice layout for all modes. Single or Multi Player. The other Wads I've done were made with only single players in mind. I've taken the time to add all the things I like in a good Deathmatch Wad as well as keeping it interesting for single players. You'll find lots of windows, hiding places, and fair deathmatch starts. I recommend Deathmatch with no monsters. When I first tested it in Deathmatch mode I feared the size(Huge) would make Deathmatch frustrating but it worked out fine. We averaged about a Frag every 1.5 mins to 2 mins which isn't bad There is an aggrevating transporter puzzle which will frustrate many. If you use your mind(it's a terrible thing to waste) it can be easily solved. Or just keep transporting until you see the transporter with the Blue Armor. I finished the Level with no problems in about 21 mins. Of course it's not going to be nearly that easy for you because I made it. Use the save early and often.

Evan H. Bynum,"This is a somewhat large level, so named for its central room with the large spiral staircase, replete with divers* weapons and sundry monsters. All secret doors have slight texture offsets, and there's a computer map behind one of them. I included every weapon at least once, and you'll find each kind of monster save the Cyberdemon and Spiderdemon somewhere in the level. One room is reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark (hint: lite-amp visors aren't always a good thing to have!). Another has three pillars in it; your selected skill level determines which one is your teleport destination. I have not played every WAD out there, so I think this is the first one to implement such a feature. There are a few wide-open areas suited especially for deathmatch play, and a preponderance of plasma rifles strewn about the level for quick rearming. Every room has at least one exit, including the lava pit outside (i.e., there are no ""traps,"" per se). If you enjoy this WAD, please email me and let me know what you liked about it, and also where you found this file (I'm curious to see how far its range grows). If you don't like this WAD, don't bother telling me, as I daresay I shan't have much time in grad school to fool around with level creation and fix what you thought I should have done.

John W. Anderson (aka Dr. Sleep),"As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time, I also tried to keep the game from being too easy. I think once you get inside, you'll find that CROSSING ACHERON has been fully optimized for DEATHMATCH. But it's just as enjoyable (if I do say so myself) in Single-player and Coöperative modes.

CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is a sequel to DANTE'S GATE -- thematically, anyway. (It's an E1M3 only because I thought the music was more appropriate than M2.) For any of the two or three of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only ""Inferno"" -- I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do this not only because I think the idea is neat, but so that people will think that I'm very clever.) I'm not so naïve as to expect everyone to rush out and get a copy of ""Inferno"" (I mean, it IS pretty tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is often well-rewarded.

(By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically). But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)

I thank those of you who sent me mail on my previous effort, and I hope to hear from more of you about this one. (Just a line would do: ""It's great!"" or ""It sucks!"" or ""Now I know what John Cormack MEANT to do in ""Unholy Cathedral."")

Greg Grimsby,"This level was originally designed as a death match level. I threw in some monsters and changed the layout to make it a playable level too. Its a pretty quick level to clear though, due to its simple design. As a Death Match level, its a pretty fun romp. Its designed to give the feel of having three floors on the same level. The bottom floor, The Sewers, has the basic weapons. The middle floor offers some beefier fire-power. The top, tech-level floor has the big-mommas. So the flow of battle is upward. It tends to be a pretty fast-paced kill- fest. There are plenty of places to commit suicide, for those so inclined 8^) Note that there are 2 exits to this level. Note also that this level is a secret level. The first exit is the normal exit. The hidden exit (nearby) brings you back to this same secret level. So it is possible to loop this level. This makes it easy to play to a certain number of kills. When you have x kills, run to the second exit.

"Magne Groenhuis, Remco Gerlich","This pwad was based on the Big Brother theme; when you're
walking around, you'll always remember that _Big_Brother_is_
watching_you_. The big brother will be informed in his 'workroom'
about the other players' whereabouts with the help of secret lines.
Those lines indicate the position of the other players. This
knowledge is of great help when being in DEATHMATCH mode. This
idea is implemented by a series of nasty secrets; it is intended
for multi-player, with only one player knowing the way to what
we call the ""Big Brother Area"" (ok, sounds stupid, but who cares).
If you don't know the place: it's still playable, although it might
be a bit too large; you don't meet the other player too often.
If however you aren't able to find the area described, feel free to
mail 1 of us for more details.","Quinet/Wyber  of the _great_ DEU 5.0 editor

Cameron Newham,"""No.... please. Not the Barrel! Anything but the Barrel.. No! Not the Barrel! Not the Barrellllllll!"" Welcome to Barrel - I hope it gives you nightmares. Certainly, if you have a machine slower than a 486 then you take your chances with this WAD as a few areas have quite complex detail. I certainly had fun making this one (and playing it). You'll find a couple of references to Scream.Wad - so if you've played that, it might help. Then again it might not. As usual, this *can* be done without cheating. * Barrel2 is an updated version of the original WAD. I have changed a few small things and fixed a playability bug in ""Hurt me plenty"".

Martin Bazley,"A medium-sized level featuring a few nice ideas, including two mazes. There *is* a secret exit to E1M9. This WAD is called 'Dreamland' because most of the design work came to me in a dream. Scary, eh!? Changes in release 2: Quite a lot, mostly affecting secret areas and map features. Nothing that affects gameplay. Some hints: Watch your back in the first maze, because those sergeants have developed a mean aim through the windows. There are three secrets in the first maze - can you find them? Before picking up the blue key, equip the chaingun and be ready to RUN!! Don't expect to survive the first time after getting the yellow key. I certainly find it difficult. Please watch the light levels in the open-air areas, because I'm very proud of them.

"Chris Pisarczyk, Jeff Shark, Callum Oliver","This is a long level with a long history. Mr. Chris (Chris Pisarczyk) and the late Phobosdeimos1 (Callum Oliver) started this map during the development of Doom the way id Did, probably a year or so before it was officially released. I joined in after Phobosdeimos1 left early in the map's development and I joined in afterwards. I did a lot of the western half of the map and Mr. Chris did a lot of the eastern half, but there are many points where we both worked on the same areas, so you really can't tell who did what. (Since Mr. Chris is a much more popular mapper than I am, I assume people probably can recognize his mapping style) Of course, ol' faithful here was rejected from the project for being about twice the size of E2M7 and having over two hundred monsters, among other things. Eventually Mr. Chris released the DTWID version of this level as ""the damned,"" which you can find here on /idgames. Meanwhile, as I gained more knowledge about mapping I dinked around a bit and made a few adjustments here and there to help with the map's flow and progression. A few bugs were also fixed, and a couple of things were added here and there to add character.  For those who haven't played this level before (most of you, I would assume), you may need to use your automap more than a few times because this map is VERY large and VERY non-linear. You may also need to wear eye protection, since it's twice as ugly as it is big. (Remember, it's DTWID so we had to channel our inner Sandy Petersen!) Also, I would advise against deathmatch on this map due to its gargantuan size. (I'm one of those guys that has to put deathmatch starts in every map he touches!)

David J. Reid a.k.a. MoonLust,"Well,...you arrive at a pre-determined point in the level...and you find some weapons and ammo...and you take a look around...and you see some really scary bit-maps come at you...and you shoot them with your 8-bit ""Digi-Blaster""...and they groan and fall over. No mystery here...just common sense. )

 Seriously, folks, this WAD has a ton of high quality samples that I felt the need to have. The size of this file is huge because of it. The base level is around 270kb ! The sounds and MIDI equal around 310kb! And this .TXT file alone is bigger than most peoples' complete WAD's.

 The MIDI file that I included was written exclusively for an SB16 or compatible - that means FM Synthesis. I felt that writing for this platform would be about the best way to convey the music to a general audience. If you have one of those wave-table synthesis jobs...Well, good for you and your good taste (again!). I, unfortunately, just have the wonderful FM synthesis to work with (and so do millions of other users). I just figured that the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few (where have I heard that before?). Now, if you want to talk about 16 bit 44.1khz digital audio samples... That's opening another can of Imps...GOTHIC MIDI mostly deals with ""CD quality"" samples for use with synths and samplers...Be on the lookout for GOTHIC files on C-Serve...

 If you find this file to be too big in size...Maybe your Nintendo is calling for you! If you find that it needs to be bigger, drop me a line and we'll Co-Author a Mother.WAD.

 Originally, this level was intended to be E2M1 but I wanted the sky texture in the first Episode. From here on in, it's E2M1 (to conform to id Software's request).

 Another worthy note: If you open this file in an Editor program you will lose the music and the sound effects. Always make a backup before you hack it up!

 Again, GOTHIC MIDI is Multimedia...and yes, that includes text!! (I don't do shabby work...If it's worth doing...it's worth doing right).","Olivier Montanuy, Ben Jordan, id Software...

Nicolas Monti,"Episode 2 themed techbase level without hell's corruption, hence the name ""immaculated"" I've tried to emulate the great work of Tom Hall and Sandy Petersen in shores of hell with a personal touch.

John W. Anderson (aka Dr. Sleep),"This is the third revision of DANTE'S GATE, and it accommodates a peculiar bug in the Doom 1.666 engine which does not allow multiple sector tagging for raised floors. I just barely caught this and had to redo a couple of sectors which raised fine in 1.2 through 1.5b, but not in 1.666. I've also taken advantage of some of the new LineDef and Sector tags for Fast Doors and Lifts. This version is fully compatible with Doom 1.666. For the most part, the only ""theme"" I had in mind was to make the level as aesthetically pleasing and consistent as possible. In other words, I wanted it to look neat. There are lots of little nooks and crannies scattered about, and (I hope) a few surprises. Here is the storyline, if you want one: After all this wackiness at the UAC base, you have lost track of your lady-friend, BEATRICE. How the two of you ever got separated is no great mystery, what with all these demons and devils running about, but you're damned if you're going to go through Hell for nothing. The only other survivor besides yourself and Beatrice is VIRGIL, the beatnik space poet. He last saw Beatrice by one of the warp-gates. Chances are she made it through -- but what's on the other side? Only one way to find out. You'll have to go through DANTE'S GATE. Please let me know what you think by E-Mail.

Derek Morton,"A huge Deathmatch play level with a few nasties added to spice things up a little bit. Vigorously tested for two man deathmatch play but should support four man play. Average two man deathmatch game lasts between 20-30 minutes when playing to ten frags. HINTS: ------ Starting Star lift: Starting about halfway between candelabra and Star lift, walk towards Star lift. Stopping Star lift: ??? Try experimenting by walking around the star's perimeter. Walking over certain sides of the pillars will also work. Monster Pit: Raise the pit with the 'eye' switch. Monsters cannot cross the blue 'monster barrier' but they can slip out the back. NOTE: Let the Baron live and watch him catch your opponent(s) when they least expect it. Automatic Door: Once the door closes it stays that way for 30 seconds. Teleporter lift: Lift to teleporter is activated by exiting the gray hallway with the red ceiling. Be quick about it! Enjoy.... p.s. Feel free to send your suggestions and/or comments but you can keep the criticisms to yourself. I'd appreciate receiving a saved four player deathmatch game.

Adam Holz,The level is pretty difficult. All it is is you and every creature in the game (except the spider demon) in one large pentagon room fighting to reach the end. Every weapon is also located on this level so it makes things easier when you reach the other levels. I have included starts for all players so you can play this level over a network or modem (Deathmatch!!!). Each wall of the level has different designs on them so some of them might be screwed up. I tried to add the goriest and most violent walls into my level so everyone can have more fun. There are no doors but plenty of walls to hide behind.

Sebastian Kirke,"Hi all you DOOMers out there! Here is something I discovered that I thought you would like to use in your own DOOM levels. It involves using the line type 47 G1 Raise Floor. Use it to make things vanish instantly, even whole rooms! I have included a sample .wad file illustrating what can be done with this phenomenon: Fire up DOOM and load magic.wad by typing: doom -file magic.wad Start a new game, then type idclev24 This means it's episode 2, level 4 (that's just cos I like the music). You'll find yourself in a small green stone room. Fire your gun and presto, the room is gone! Now you will see a gray column on the right. There are two things that can happen: 1. Fire at the column first, it disappears. Then fire at the computer block, it too disappears. 2. Fire at the computer block first, it rises! Then fire at the column and it will disappear. Now look around and you'll see a marble block, a pipe wall and a door behind it. There are two things that can happen: 1. Fire at the marble first, the pipe wall disappears. Then fire at the door, it disappears too. 2. Fire at the pipe first, it rises to the ceiling! You can now fire at the marble and the door will disappear, but you'll never get to the other side. Can you imagine the possibilities? Get editing folks! (;-> You can even use this effect to create vertical scrolling textures! i.e. floors that rise endlessly cos they can't find the next floor to stop at.

It's Central Command. It seems the UAC boys at the Phobos1 research lab have been screwing around again and now they have a situation their security forces can't handle. The last report received from the facility indicated that the base had been overrun and that the enemy had begun to make ""modifications"". A UAC strike team which had been sent in have not been heard from since they landed. Your Orders: Proceed immediately to Phobos... Rendevous with your team in orbit.... Your Mission: Regain control of Phobos1 at all costs.... Everything was normal as you boarded the drop- ship. Reentry went smoothly and you were cruising 30,000 feet above the surface of Phobos, heading for the base. Your buddy nudges you and asks you to jerk his finger. You're just about to oblige when suddenly the ship lurches. An explosion, screams, then the lights go out.... You wake up in a pile of smoking debris. You're glad to be alive.

Rick DeMar,"So here it is: Paradox, E1M2. Where Showdown only included my favorite four of the baddies, Paradox has them all. (With the exception of the bosses.) Also present are some interesting plays on the usual constructs. As before, I spent exhaustive (No joke there!) man hours playing and playing to bring the difficulty to just the right point. It CAN BE WON, providing you bear in mind the following points: 1: DOOM has a save game feature... 2: Monsters shoot too, so watch your ass! 3: What sometimes looks peaceful and innocent is probably a trap! Spare no caution! 4: Ammo is quite transient; use only what you have to and be careful what type you use. 5: Moving objects are much harder to hit than ones that just stand there and let themselves be shot...:) Once again, this level gets much easier with practice, making it fun to come in on a fleshing rampage once you get good at it!","Extreme thanks to Raphael Quinet and Brendon Wyber for creating DOOM EDITOR UTILITIES and to id Software for creating that awesome gaming experience; DOOM!

Dan Patanella,"The layout of this WAD for the Ultimate Doom
is *very* loosely based on Keating Hall and the Walsh Library, two buildings 
that Fordham alumni will recall with varying degrees of fondness. Personally, 
I think both buildings look like Castle Frankenstein, so I amalgamated them. 
The theme of this level is vaguely medieval or sword and sorcery, so most of 
the monsters tend to be Imps or Bull Demons. (After the largely tech-oriented 
levels of Gatchaman Doom, I needed a little change of pace. ) I like making
WADs with labyrinth components, and this one has a maze in the flooded 
basement. This medium-sized WAD is very nonlinear (in fact, it doesn't matter 
what order you get the keys in) so enjoy!

Incidentally, the real-life Fordham Campus is not far from where Edgar Allen 
Poe wrote ""The Raven."" 

Most of the new textures contained in Fordham Doom were really just existing 
Doom textures combined in new ways courtesy of NWT. (The SKY2 texture was
taken from a photo of my own that I scanned in). For those of you into 
elaborate architecture and special effects, this is a rather modest WAD, 
mainly deep water and window-above-window. You won't notice the special 
effects unless you actively seek them out. As far as deathmatch goes, I've
included deathmatch starting points, but this level really wasn't designed
for deathmatch.","Once more, Len Pitre is the supreme playtester, 
a true master of offering great suggestions that always make a level 
better. Additional playtesting and suggesting came from Rez, again with  
very good, constructive criticism. TJ Fisher was probably the first person 
who suggested that a Doom level based on Fordham would be a good idea, so 
I ought to thank her before she decides it would also be a good idea to sic 
her cats on me.",New level from scratch,"DEU 5.1, BSP 2.3, NWT, DMGRAPH, WADED",May be slow on machines older than a 486,,2,1,11,4,1999-01-06,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/9901-fordham-doom/?do=download&csrfKey=df22adec1cab91bdec6ac2c53df0e31b,Doom,d-f,Fordham Doom ,fordham.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/fordham_FORDHAM.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/fordham_FORDHAM_E2M1.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/fordham_FORDHAM_E2M1.txt

Dan L'Ecuyer,"This is the last of a four-level series. Here you encounter The Conspiracy. Something is not right at the UAC (stay tuned for the full story). This is a fairly large map with a lot of detail, including several special effects (dontcha love that?). Like the first three maps in this series, the emphasis is on a realistic look and feel. The game play is designed for the average player but it's still tough no matter how you cut it. I have included a demo of me finishing part 1 in UV according to the rules of the challenge. Of course, you will need DOA1-1.WAD to play the demo.

David Mehrmann,"This is my second real level, and I think
it's much better than my first level. The Fragstation is designed for 
deathmatch,but it'll also be fun when played in cooperative or single player 
mode. I tried to put as much details in as possible, and I took out the map 
room, because a few players didn't agree with me that such a room is useful. 
However, the level is still one of the bigger ones, and sometimes it may 
happen that all player search each other but cannot find anyone. I know 
that's annoying for you Doom2 Map7 lovers, but this level is made 
for searching and hunting,not blasting away the other players every 5 seconds. 
I suggest for deathmatch that you play this level in skill 1, 'cause the only 
weapons there are the shotgun,chaingun,chainsaw and the berserk. This causes 
longer, more interesting fights and hunts, before someone wins and starts 
singing an satirical song to tease the looser... :-] !","Robin Benecke (testing),Wolfang Helmers (testing),Jürgen Helmers (testing),

John Wakelin,"Unlike LURKER this is nothing but all out action from the get go. If you like rolling over your frag count, look no further. This was designed with -altdeath in mind, but should be as fun to play regular. Our first night with the final version of this lasted 5 hrs. (Hint - when you roll the frag count the second time go ahead and sneak a peek at your watch). Here's the deal, eight circular rooms joined by halls that intersect in a central hub. Four of them are higher than the other four. There is a platform in the center that allows players to run across without dropping to the lower level, if they are running top speed. The platform drops if you tap the side from one of the lower halls. On the upper level, however, if as you are sprinting across you tap the space-bar(or whatever opens doors for you) the platform will also drop. This means that whoever is chasing you will suddenly be on the lower level. One other interesting feature: in the center (on the platform) is an arrow it points toward the room with the rocket launcher. Whenever someone goes for it, this arrow will turn black and there will be a black arrow on the ceiling, alerting the other players. There is a co-op exit in the eastern crushing hall. The switch that opens the exit door is behind the rocket launcher in the westen end of the level. There is no plasma rifle or BFG in this WAD. There is only health (in the form of beserkers) in ""I,m too young to die"" other-wise what you start with, is it.",ID SOFTWARE - For the game and the freedom to do things like this.

Andre Lucas,"Originally intended as a two-player DeathMatch blast, this level is made for high-speed friend-killing carnage. It does play OK on single player, though, as the (reasonably) action packed demo shows. This demo shows you all the hidden bits as well, so as to make DeathMatch games fair. We (Andre and Tim McLachlan) wrote some new music for our first levels, but it sounded really awful on SoundBlaster. (well, Pantera- style drums are hard to get right at the best of times!) If people really want more music (and I can see how they might, the number of times I've heard the E1M1 music) then E-Mail Tim MacLachlan about his music library. He's on summer recess too, so don't expect a prompt reply. If your version has some additional wads (THRASH.WAD, TWILIGHT.WAD) then these contain the music and you can include it with DOOM -file  .

Alberto BARSELLA,"the setting is open-field/city-like, bright light, many buildings,
high demand of processing power.

This is my first attempt at creating WAD files for DOOM.
The creation of this WAD was made possible by the two great programs
called DEU 5.1 and BSP 1.1.
In this WAD I made my attempt at the creation of multi-floor buildings
using teleporters along staircases. The only 'true' teleporter is the
one in the beginning, all subsequent teleport effects should be ignored
(if you don't look at the map too often the illusion of multi-floor
is better....) The jammed door that you will find helps creating the
effect of two separate floors.
I also tried to concentrate in creating a realistic (and also playable)
lighting conditions, I wanted to have buildings cast shadows, but that
would require more hours of sector hacking and many more 2-sided LineDefs
which would slow down the game a lot, so I dropped the idea.
As for the difficulty, this is an average level, the experienced player
will have no problem to complete it.","Ben Jos Walbeehm for testing the level and for corrections to the English text, everyone else who sent me comments about version 0.9.",New level from scratch,DEU 5.0 and DEU 5.1 + BSP 1.0 and BSP 1.1 and dmgraph,None,Tooooo much!,3.6,16,11,20,1994-05-25,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/263-deadbasewad-wasteland-dead-base/?do=download&csrfKey=39b9ab3332e88a113a6a8a2eb9fa7d44,Doom,d-f,DEADBASE.WAD - `Wasteland: Dead Base' ,deadbs10.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/deadbs10_DEADBASE.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/deadbs10_DEADBASE_E2M1.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/deadbs10_DEADBASE_E2M1.txt

Ron Williams,"A massive level that originally started out looking like a dragon.
However, due to size limitations of the DEU editors (See below), I was
forced to shrink and stuff a few sections until it ended up looking
more like a mutant hunchback doberman with a severe case of hemorrhoids.
My options were to redraw to make the artwork appear better, or go with
a level that is an outright blast to play.
  Easy choice - Artwork be damned, let's kick some ass!
  I didn't care much for the ""Let me see you get through THIS!"" kind of
attitude that seems to have destroyed the fun in what would otherwise have
been some really good PWADs, so this level is unconditionally playable.
There are only a couple of what I would consider tough puzzles to get past,
and there are no death pits: If you can get in - you can get out.

many.......this has taken probably well over 24 hours over more than a week so

OH, did I mention, it was in HELL? And the rules aren't fair? You just look, grin, and chuckle. You make the first step toward the playhouse, and you are teleported into the center of it. So now inside of the heart of all that makes evil fun, all you can think about is knocking the crap out of Satan's little hench men.

Playhouse in HELL was fun, but now you're moving past that chaos.  You hit the switch to stop this nightmare and continue blowing up all of HELL..  But after you flip the switch, did you leave the Playhouse?  You turn and re-open the door.  It must've been the Playhouse last trick.  You find yourself right at HELL's Mansion.  Home of Satan and his creatures.  What does one make of this......A MESS that's what.  Time to grab up your weapons, move on and continue the trail of blood (and mess Satan's nice floors, hehehe)!

After such a HELLISH night, you decide to return to a nice (yeah right) little hotel you know, The Under Arms.  The security and staff of Satan's hotel come out to greet you (and you have a shotgun for them to meet).  The creatures around the entrance decide they want a piece of you too!

Todd Prince,"This is a DOOM level created using DoomEd - The Real Thing by Geoff Allan. It is a SINGLE player level. This is one of the toughest levels that I have created. It is the first in a series of Imp's challenges. It took myself and the Beta testers quite a few hours to complete this level. Now, we can complete the level in about six minutes. Comments on this level are welcome and I can be reached via Compuserve at address 73131,1037. I hope you enjoy this one. It is a real challenge.","Beta Testers TK and ""Hacker""

Steve Rountree,"I did not build this level with a lot of tricks and traps in mind, though there are a few of them, but instead as a good old shotgun crawl. You will have a variety of weapons to choose from but you will have to use your resources wisely. I tried to construct this level so that it can be completed if you use your head as well as your trigger finger. Running around blasting wildly at anything that moves may get you to the end of the level, but it may leave you a little short- handed to deal with what might be lurking there. I hope you enjoy this level. It took me a long time to finish it (I am constantly refining and touching up). I originally designed it for single or cooperative, but I have included several deathmatch starts and with the level's connectivity I think that it could work fairly well in deathmatch.

Justin Madigan (you might know me from other wads),"STORY SO FAR... A rebel planet in a barren sector of the universe, called Talay, has not contacted with anyone for 25 years. Today, at UAC, they have made sucessful communication. After a two-hour talk, UAC has agreed to send all their present information to them, if they do the same on Talay. The story is sent through a portal and into the hands of government officials. Here's the jist of it: They have been useing advanced technology for the last 25 years, and didn't want the ideas to be stolen before they could lock 'em. Now the procedure is finished. They can put anything into this ""black hole"" and have it appear anywhere in the galaxy. The only problem is that anything can beam back. Throughout the year, strange things have been coming through, weird bugs, artifacts, even an egg. It seems as though another race is toying with them. The Talains have taken on an evil way, being so caught up in protecting their software, they take humans and do insane expiriments, like testing how long they can survive while being flooded with Carbon Monoxide, and trapping them. But the test subjects, or logs, have been on strike. they've been kiling everyone and everything they find. Some have been put in cells that will explode on contact. ----END OF COPY---- Back at UAC, Talay pleads for more workers for its Base. To keep this truce stable, they ask how many.

Steve Terry,"This WAD has either no theme, or many themes (I'm still trying to figure it out...) I just threw everything I could think of into this level. (Kitchen sink WAD) NOTES ON MULTIPLAYER: I originaly designed this level for single player only. Then when I got a real modem, I started playing deathmatch and realized that I somehow had to make this level compatible for deathmatch. (You will see why it's not when you play it single player...) I therefore added several ""deathmatch"" doors. They are all secret doors, so as to not detract from single player play, but can be seen in yellow (or brown) on the map. There is also a giveaway in each texture. (Offlined, slightly different, etc.) The doors require a red key card which you will not be able to find in single player mode. If you try to open a secret and it says it needs a red key card, you have found one of these doors. Don't worry, the secret total will not be affected by these areas. These areas not only make the level deathmatchable, but connect several areas to make the level non-linear. The exit is also a cooperative exit in dmatch. You won't be able to activate it by yourself. It is near the original exit switch, which is blocked in deathmatch. This level can NOT be played cooperatively :(","Everybody responsible for the production of the book titled ""Tricks of the DOOM Gurus,"" for producing such a huge well of knowledge about WAD file design. My brother, who came up with several ideas, including the Satanic room at the end of the initial corridor. (Check out how aligned those textures are!!!)

Tom Simon (Sime),"BACKGROUND: I like wads with a kinda theme, not just haphazard stuff thrown together. Ones that sorta make sense; as much as critters from hell can make sense, that is. This one is kinda hell-based, but not actually in hell itself. It's some kind of an outdoor type area on Earth or one of the moons of Mars (you decide...) Anyhow, it's been overrun and slowly being converted by hellspawn, which of course you must utterly and irrevocably slay, being the fearless Space Marine. (all rights reserved, etc. etc.) No rest for the wicked... Pretty basic formula: Find the switches to throw to allow you access to the keys you need to proceed though the level. Takes awhile to even see the first (yellow) key, so don't get discouraged. All the stuff you need to do the level is provided. Just look for it. (i.e. the radiation suits) No cyber-anythings or BFG's here. I like the more low-tech slugfest weaponry. Thank God for shotguns. Pittsburgh sports fans will like one of the secret areas. And if you don't, well, get bent. =)","Thanx to the folks at SAMS publishing for making the Secrets of the DOOM Gurus book which got me into this whole mess.  More thanx to Justin Fisher for 1) creating his AliensTC.wad, which scared the wits out of me, and 2) for kindly allowing me to sample a sound from this same wad for my level (this guy should be working for id, AliensTC is an amazing wad!!!).  Also thanx to Ben Morris and Bill Neisius for creating the idiot-proof (mostly! I still managed to screw some things up) utilities I used for this level.  id doesn't need my thanks, they get enough of my money. =) I also used a sound from the OttawaU.wad. I tried to contact one of the authors of it, but never reached him. Sorry! I hearby give credit to Jean-Serge Gagnon and the other authors of that wad (don't know their names but there were more than one of them) for the sound and take no credit for creating this sound myself. I just really like it so I used it.  I also included a sound I downloaded from the net, and no doubt it's copyrighted six ways to next Tuesday by some movie studio. I don't take any credit for this one either, nor do I intend to profit from it. (This is my first wad and I don't wanna get in trouble, so I'm trying to make these things clear.) Blah blah blah, yata yata yata, the thing the thing and the thing. FUTURE PLANS (as if you really care...) Next up is a multi-level Wolfenstein themed wad for DOOM 2. I'm sure it's been done before, but hopefully not in the exact same way I am planning. I wanna have it based on Hilter finding an evil artifact and using it to summon demons etc. which (surprise surprise) get out of control in the nazi stronghold. Guess who plays the part of the British intelligence agent sent in to investigate? At my rate of editing, look for it when DOOM 8 is released. =) And remember not to cheat. It's no fun if you do!!!","New level from scratch--""Only"" took about, oh, 9 months to make! That includes learning how to edit from scratch, losing half my wad to a bug in EdMap, finding out that I really didn't understand WADED's make sector function, and finally deciding on DCK. So I'm only a _partial_ idiot. Plus my mom discovered solitare and my sister found Myst. How's a poor guy supposed to get his DOOM fix??!!??","DCK 2.2, DMAUD, DMGRAPH","Something was goofy with the reject map. (Reject map was too small?) It seems to have repaired itself (I hope) however. But it runs OK on my 486 DX 50Mhz. So if you've got at least that then I guess it will run fast enuf and you will be OK. I WAS also having some problems with viewing the large outdoor courtyard from the northeast corner of it (would crash to DOS) but I cut out a few lines/visplanes and it seems to be OK now.  I tried to align the textures as best I could as well. Don't care for sloppy or random stuff. AND you can't get stuck anywhere. Nothing burns me up more than falling in a pit of goo and not being able to escape from it. Putting in a pit you can't see the bottom of is just _begging_ me to jump into it.

Where can you go when it's time to relax - to get away from it all - in short, what's Leona gonna do when she gets here?

Come join the fun..."" The brochure suddenly bursts into flames and you're blinded by a green flash and burning fingers. You find yourself in a stone walled room, a shotgun at your feet.

At the hardest level, it's got two cyberdemons. The middle levels have a cacodemon or two and a spiderdemon. The easisiest level is best for using `-respawn', as it only has one imp, some troopers, and some sergents. Weapon-wise, it's got one of each weapon, except the chainsaw.

...but not all had gone according to plan. The ship was attacked and boarded just as it entered orbit around Mars. You awakened from hypersleep to find your crewmates either mutated or dead. Your objective was clear: end the CONTAMINATION or die trying...

Kenneth S. Forte,"Literally Heaven and Hell. If you can't figure out which way to go to get to Heaven when you start this level you need help. Heaven is simply a large stockpile of weapons, armor, and health bonuses (Apparently the NRA was right). There are also a few of Hell's more putrid denizens placed in cages for your safety and viewing pleasure, so take the opportunity to waste them. Every type of weapon is available in Heaven except for the BFG (is there one? Go to Hell to find out). Hell is a fairly linear place. In Single Player Mode if you die in Hell you are dead and thats that, but for Multi-Player mode, measures have been taken to ensure that any players that die can re-enter Hell safely many times over. This level isn't meant to be tricky or witty, it is purely kill kill kill kill kill kill jump kill.....","The authors of DOOM, DEU, and BSP, of course.",New level from scratch,DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0,"None, at least not fatal ones. It is a very large level, and probably shouldn't be attempted on some slower systems. ""Disappearing Things"" effects used to occur on this level, until I found out that DOOM really doesn't like too many objects (I had at one point over 900 things, and that was cut in half), but it may still occur occasionally. Also in the corridor with the large skull key doors the game seems to like to inflict damage on you even if you have a radsuit and there aren't any monsters around. This is not a result of paper thin walls, and seems to happen randomly, but it does happen quite often in that particular area.

Robert Zubek,"""Well, well, well..."" started Hades, ""You have solved that little puzzle(*) with amazing speed... Good for you, my boy. How about something tougher?"" Answering your icy glance, he quickly added ""Okay, just a _little_ tougher..."" His wide smile exposed strong and healthy teeth. Suddenly it came to your mind that no one ever saw Hades smiling -- or did not live to tell about it? ""The problem is,"" he continued, ""that I have one little palace I don't really like. One architect designed it for me some time ago, he was trying to suck up to me, you know, so I would let him live another 50 years or so. I didn't. Anyway, the place didn't suit my taste, really; it's so small and tight, and definitely not warm enough for a winter palace. So I decided that with some remodeling it would make an interesting puzzle for you. How about it? Oh, come on, I know you start to like these puzzles, don't you?"" His voice became more and more patronizing. ""It's good, you know, for your body, mind... and speed!"" he said, and honoured you with another smile, clearly enjoying himself. Impatience, however, overcame him, and he quickly finished up his monologue -- ""You are really good in conversations. It's a pity we've got to go now. I can't wait to see you in that palace.

Mike Ruggles,"After playing many wads in deathmatch mode, I decided it was time to try to create one of my own. This level has many sniping places. There is a central teleportation room that takes you to the other areas. Each area will almost always have a way to shoot at someone in another area. There are switches that allow you to open an area previously unaccessable. Sometimes they open shortcuts to another area as well. As I said, this was originally designed to be a deathmatch level. However, as I got further and further into making it, it got kinda big. It's still a good deathmatch level for 3 or more players, with 2 players being a little bit harder to find the other person at times. There are quite a few smaller monsters, and several of the big guys as well (Most of whom you can avoid without having to fight them).

Jeff Wofford,"This is certainly my finest level thus far.  I designed this level with
the single player in mind, but the level is especially engaging when used
as a deathmatch arena, so either type of player should find it a treat.
The level features complex and realistic lighting effects which add tension
and ambience to the level.  It is quite a difficult level in Ultra-
Violence mode, but I have been thorough in providing easier situations
for lower skill levels.  Prepare to jump with fear more than a few times
in this level: I've used some surprise techniques which I have not seen
used elsewhere in the DOOM .WAD world, and if an essential element of your

Steve Rountree,"Here is yet another new level for DOOM. If you're like me there can never be enough new levels. It is a brand new level that I made with DEU 5.0 which is a fantastic editor. This is the second distribution of this level. The first one had a few bugs in it that caused the x-ray vision problem with several of the linedefs. I used the BSP program to eliminate these, so now this level is clean. Since this is a new map for E2L1 it will only work with the registered version. I would have made it a larger level, but the x-ray vision problem pissed me off so I cut it short to start on another new level. To load this level type: Doom -file sr21.wad -devparm -wart 2 1 I didn't create any variation between skill levels so no matter what level you play it on you'll receive the same challenge (Nightmare being the obvious exception). I did this because I would guess that those of you who play these new levels do so because you've beaten the original ones over and over and are not beginners in the wonderful world of DOOM. I originally designed this level for single player use, but you can play it on multi or deathmatch. I hope you like it. Have fun. p.s.: Just thought I'd let you know that there are a few secrets in this new level but I designed it so that the true challenge would be just finishing it, without cheating.",,New from scratch,DEU 5.0,?,,2.5,10,15,13,2005-02-04,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/13210-new-doom-level-episode-2-level-1/?do=download&csrfKey=6ad275a9f8b6fdef774fe7b29d25b7f7,Doom,m-o,New Doom Level: Episode 2 Level 1 ,newsr21.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/newsr21_SR21.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/newsr21_SR21_E2M1.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/newsr21_SR21_E2M1.txt

,"Well, this is a very impressive episode including 9 _excellent_
levels.  All the levels in this episode were created by myself, excluding
e1m5, which was designed by a friend.  We feel that any DOOM fanatic will
enjoy this episode and will be completely impressed by the work put into it.

        Most levels on the Internet suck.  It's a fact, but these 9 levels do 
not suck.  id Software, if they ever saw this, would most likely want to know
where the two of us were when they were designing the original DOOM levels.  
It's taken roughly a year to design the levels, in fact...I never planned to
have any nice levels...much less a whole episode.  It seems that after I 
figured out how to use DEU that level making just sorda seemed fun, so I 
designed levels like mad.  ...but, I am a perfectionist (in most respects) and
therefore I insisted that the levels I designed were no less greater than 
those in the actual game.  I felt that if they could make complex levels, then
so can I...and I did :)  Most of the levels in here have been zipped and 
distributed via local BBS, but even those were completely checked and re-
checked for bugs/parts I found to be lacking ""id"" quality.  So, what you have
here is pure DOOM art.  ...not to mention my last DOOM work that will ever be.
I am _tired_ of making levels.  My creativity is draining (I also want to 
maintain a life :), etc., so I have decided to stop while I'm ahead. 

        So, play this all the way through...it is arranged as the original
DOOM, smaller/easier levels first which work up in size/difficulty.  You will
see the quality, and you may also wonder how I kept my sanity...so, have a 
blast!",,,"The editor of choice has been DEU521GC, until I found a DEU port

          except E1M3 and E1M5.  BSP1.2x has a bug and wouldn't build E1M3,

sat.wad is the 1st episode, it sucks.
niftylvl.wad is the second episode. It has some of the better levels I have made
the e3mx ones all contain bosses. It was gonna be a boss lvl episode. But I stopped dooming b4 it was finished. E3m6 has an exit, but no way to get to it yet, the lvl was never finished.

Tovi Grossman,"Needless to say, this is my first level. I think I did a pretty good job but if I were able to force myself to look at the DEU screen again and make another level it would be way better. The best thing about my level is that the secrets aren't all composed of hidden doors who's textures have been cleverly alligned. To get acess to my secret areas you'll have to use your brain, which most DOOMers enjoy. And at no point will you need to find a hidden door to complete the level. Any moron can go around a whole level pushed up against a wall pressing the spacebar rapidly. My level is also very straight forward. You won't have much choice to where you go, the level will direct you through itself. I have put in an area map early in the game because they are cool. Some areas though are hidden so it doesn't give the whole level away. This level is ment to be played on ultraviolent, save often or don't save at all, whichever you prefer.

Chris Carollo,"I've tried many a deathmatch level, and for the most part, I've been dissatisfied. Many of the levels I've seen seem too much like 'novelty' levels, not of the quality or style of id's original maps. When I set out to make this level, I tried to keep in mind the levels from id, especially E1M1 and E1M5, which are my favorites for deathmatch. I also tried to keep the level very small and open, while always leaving at least two ways out of any area. The frags should be quick, but not necessarily 'cheap', because you can normally get out of any situation in which you may find yourself. Some rather kick-ass frags to attempt: - Shoot a rocket up the open lift from the courtyard and hit your opponent. My personal favorite. :) - Set the lift into the off from the stone room, but don't fall in. Then drop down after the lift has fully lowered, and shoot your opponent. - Shoot your opponent in mid-air as he jumps off the hallway into the courtyard.",,New level from scratch,EdMap v1.22 for level creating and editing DEU 5.21gcc for texture aligning,"None, and I've tested it extensively (25+ hrs of deathmatching).

Although saved as E1M1, it is probably a better replacement for E1M4 or E2M2. It includes an exit to the secret level, but it's tough to find. The regular exit takes a bit of fancy finger- work to get to as well!

Only contains Weapons 1-5, but adds a Plasma gun (and no extra cells) in Deathmatch mode.

I've tried to keep all textures etc. pretty consistent, except for a few special areas, and I think I've gotten rid of all HOM effects. 8-) The only construction problem that I can find is in the deep blue Demon room (you'll know it when you get there), that sometimes the screen gets stuck in 'Cyberspace' 8-( - any hints on how to fix this gratefully received. Other than that, all walls have been aligned unless they (a) hide secret doors, or (b) are meant to be that way (cf the spiral staircase)

This is probably a little easy as is, but I'm going to add more monsters for UV, and take away a few imps and sergeants for ITYTD

As this is my first level, I'd be really pleased to get some feedback, especially from Watcher (there's only one small maze 8-)) and Cameron Newham - you guys write the best damned reviews I've EVER read! - even if I don't always agree with you.

Alberto BARSELLA,"the setting is inside a volcano: there are corridors, rooms and
some larger areas. Overall the level should run smoothly on all machines.

The creation of this WAD was made possible by the two great programs
called DEU 5.1 and BSP 1.1 (dmgraph and wt helped, too).
In this WAD I continued my work in the creation of realistic
lighting effects. When you walk through corridors you will find
areas lit by torches. Don't expect any torch in natural cracks.....
Some of the rooms have objects (pillars, etc) which
cast shadows onto the floor and on the walls.
This level takes place in a volcano, volcanoes contain lava, and
lava is deadly. If you fall into the lava YOU ARE DEAD. There's
no way to get out of it. If you see dangerous ledges then SAVE YOUR GAME.
Special effects include: waterfall with sound, a couple of attempts to
recreate cave-ins, a fallen bridge and computer messages!

If the attack isn't stopped, chances are that Phobos may suffer the same fate as Deimos. By disappearing, it would expose the main Mars bases to subsequent demonic onslaught. It is your duty to enter the maintenance rooms of this passage and clear any alien infestation, to delay their offensive before UAC military reinforcements arrive. If you discover any demonic portals or gateways, you are ordered to follow them through. Research by Dr Betruger has shown that these gates lead into habitable - if hostile - new worlds, and from your experience you should be able to survive them.

Jaime Landauer,"Here is a nice one ! This map consists of 4 sections that I'm sure you will enjoy it. Users Guide: At the beginning you will be in the first section which includes the big grey saloon, the patio and the metallic corridors. Then, the other sections are the Catacombs and the Sewer. The latest one is the Red room which contains the Blue key necessary to open the door and exit the game. Keep playing ! you finally will be at the Red room. In the game you will pass close to the Red room, but you need the yellow key to enter in it. (there is not red key for the Red room). I recommend that you enter into the Red room using the door inside the red corridor, not the door in front of the shiny metallic corridor. Press the switch and quickly leave this room from the same direction you came inside (if you are still alive), then go around thru the shiny hall and enter into the Red room thru the other door. Into the Red room, for your protection from the Cyberdemon, there is a little bunker that you can hide and think. Close to the bunker you almost can see the Rocket Launcher and boxes of rockets, if the Cyber is not around (he is deaf), then leave the bunker and try to get this arsenal. Once you get this, isn't necessary to turn around looking for the Bunker, since a teleporter inside a little room in front of the rockets will send you back to the Bunker. Now that you got this arsenal, try to leave the bunker by the door that you came in, go around thru the shiny hall and attack the Cyber from the windows or from the other entrance. Don't get to close to these windows, he will fire at you! If you run out of rockets use the machine gun or the shotgun. If you are smart, he will die. By killing the Cyber will be easier to get the blue key. Be ready to save your game many times in this section ! Please: Always Refer to the Red room with some respect, and write this name with capital R. I included in this Zip file, good music from one of the Episodes of Doom.

Bob Lange,"Parthenon was originally a beautiful rendition of the structure of the same name in Greece, but HoM considerations reduced it to the vestige you see in the exact middle of the map. (For those interested, the original still exists, and if I ever find a way to use it, it will appear in it's entirety.) What was hoped to be a challenging pwad for deathmatches grew into this sprawling series of hallways around a large courtyard with a few challenging outer rooms. I'm still learning, so constructive criticism is appreciated. BTW, as the editors continue to increase in utility, one has to look at wads completed when the editors were much more crude with a degree of wonder.

Chris Plummer,"Overview: The pace of action in The Pentadrome is best suited for cooperative play, but once the monsters are thinned down, it's a fabulous place for a deathmatch. With few dead ends and lots of twists and secrets, The Pentadrome keeps you on the edge of your mouse pad (and your sanity!) The objective is to explore the three major regions of the Pentadrome, which requires the player to locate 3 key cards, and then make it to the exit lift alive. If you make it to the exit lift and still have a load of energy... find the secret button chamber (it'll be close by) that activates the showdown phase of The Pentadrome. If you have the stomach for the finale, be prepared to re-explore your immediate surroundings and take advantage of secret passages. If you look close, you'll always find them. The finale comes in two phases. The second phase of the finale requires some creativity in getting up to the room that triggers the final showdown. When you find some new buttons durring the end-game, try pushing them and returning to the main arena to see the results. Good luck! Give-Aways: The endgame is tough, but there is more than enough ammo around. You have to find it, though. Try the silver wall at the top of the exit lift! Once you find the exit room (Southern tip of the main arena), you can take the lift to the exit or push on the West wall, which reveals a secret room. There you'll find a BFG and a button that triggers the first round of the showdown. A new chamber and tunnel also opens up. The buttons that you find durring the end game (in the new tunnel) allow you to change the topography of the main arena in the Pentadrome. This can be useful when being chased by Cybedemons. Each ""arm"" of the main arena is split into four definned surfaces: 1) The main floor 2) Inner Column 3) Mid Fang 4) Outer Fang The Mid and Outer Fangs are arranged symetrically, like concentric triangles. The Inner Columns are in the middle of each Mid Fang. All of this is part of the main floor when the game begins. The middle button (of three) raises the Inner Columns to the ceiling. The other two buttons raise the Mid and Outer Fangs in incements of 16 and 32. The two buttons directly behind the outer buttons lower the corresponding Fangs to the floor. This can also be done with the two levers located in the balcony overlooking the main floor of the arena, which are visible at the start of the game. To trigger the final phase of the finale, you have to raise the Fangs high enough into the air so that you can leap from the arena balcony onto the Outer Fang and then jump over to secret room that the Cacodemons came from. There you'll see a door and a button that starts the second round, which will also open up a new tunnel.

Other than that, CH Retro Episode uses 99% of the episode 1 design 'codex'. There's only a few things such as a couple of episode 2 flats, which makes it deviate a tad. I've tried to make it look and play like Romero's masterpiece, but have also mixed my own style in with it to make it unique. And please, don't warp into the middle of the episode. It's an episode and ment to be played as such. You'll get the most out of it by playing it from start to end. And E1M5 along with E1M7 is really worth making it through to! They're some of my better levels. Finally, I'd like you to NOT use features such as jumping if you choose to play it using a sourceport! The names for each individual level in the epiosde is as follows: E1M1: First Contact E1M2: Computers and Electronics E1M3: Main-Frame E1M4: Command Center E1M5: Chemical Processing Plant E1M6: Primary Base E1M7: Laboratories E1M8: Old Habits... E1M9: Strategical Offensive Array",Big thanx to my fellow DooM loving friend Paul Corfiatis for playtesting and giving good advice! Doomcenter Boss Ben 'BigDog' Swarts for E1M6 testing and stuff! Kristian Aro for playtesting E1M6! Anthony Soto for good episode 1 designing advice!

Jon Landis,"Here is your chance to take a lovely tour of the subterranian sewer system that exists to fulfil all of Hell's waste disposal needs. But what is that coming out of the pipe?! I guess it is time to take out the trash! Mangle the monsters, clean the sewers out, explore horrific ventilation shafts and find the pipe that will bring you back to the surface. For all of you thrill seekers out there, try ULTRAVIOLENCE... You will have a little trouble getting down the first pipe, but after that it will be smooth sailing, yea right!  A warning to anyone who thinks they are cool and anyone who downloads a wad file, then uses IDDT IDDQD and IDKFA and breezes through the wad. You will be pleasently surprized by this wad file. I put a few IDDT busters in there for all the cheaters of the world to be discouraged with. Be warned. I am a crafty bastard. This Wad file is a bitch and there are many chances to die, so die and have fun doing so. There is a demo included It is the SECOND demo, so wait for it. For all you network jocks out there... This level was designed for CO-OP play. Deathmatch starts have been inserted, but Deathmatch sucks with this level. There is a great possibility that one or more players will get stuck someplace. And a greater possibility that any player will never see any of the other players. Go CO-OP for this one.","ID software (for such a kick-ass game!!!) Raphael Quinet and Brendom J.

In the last room you can walk on the toxic waste and get to a spot where the entire screen turns green. That is pretty cool, but an error! Some monsters regain their hearing. The lift near the end gets you stuck sometimes because the monsters set it off. The music sometimes just cuts out. The demo does not complete the level.

Mordak,"Well, it's a little bit of everything (as you can/ will see). As far as I know it's the biggest pwad I've ever seen (if you find something bigger please tell me, and I'll add something to mine to keep it number one :). I've been running it on my 486DX33 and UV has a pretty good speed, but ID (hehehe -see for yourself) slows down if you leave any monsters behind (486DX50 recommended for ID). Reject screws it up a little... its kinda like every monster has the ""deaf/ambush"" bit set, but you get more speed.  With this PWAD you can exterminate the Energizer Bunny, blast Beavis, blow up Butt-Head, bezerker punch Barney, cook the charging Cacodemon, and phscorch the Phsykick (KICK IT! KICK IT! KICK IT!) Phskull! That's right, it has sprites (and sounds, and grafx, and a cool level). You can also kill a Spider Demon with a chainsaw -no worries. And because the BFG 9000 is so hard to get, I recommend you use the dehacked patch to make ID quasi-fair (or those Cyber Demons might getcha). Whatever else would you expect from Dimension 42, the answer to the universe? In the final confrontation you must enter the Barney (read barney.txt) House and kill Barney and all his clones. -Good Luck- That's the only theme in this PWAD, all else is just chaos. I hope you like it. I might expand later to make a whole episode, tell me how you like this level. Thank you very much, 49 inch nails. Goodnight.

Ed Cripps (Violent Ed),"The UAC had sent 5 teams to see if anything on the old Phobos bases could be salvaged.  There
was still top secret projects untouched by the demons deep within the base.  4 of the 5 teams sent
there had reported good results, one diddnt report back at all.  They were sent to the east wing of
the Toxin Refinery to poke around and see if there was any sign of hells forces still about.  They 
just dissapeared.  The phone rings at 6:am,  nobody calls this early unless....shit!  You finally
pick up after 25 or so rings,  it must have been important.  Once you heard the generals voice you 
diddnt even let him finish and just grabbed a side arm and headed to base to board a transfer ship 
to the south east wing of the toxin refinery and see what happened to team #5 and report back to UAC.
This is just an intorduction to a series of levels that will not require a new port, just good ol' 
fashioned raw doom.

Greytale,"RIVER33.wad is extremely large, and a VERY difficult map to complete, even
on God mode.  The map requires a ""search-every-nook-and-cranny"" attitude,
and will take alot of time to finish.  There are alternate ways of finishing
the map, but ultimately the user's best bet is to get ahold of all the keys.

Upon finding the exit, the user may realize that the switch is a 2-sided
linedef with a false texture, viewable from only ONE side--a feat that I'VE 
never seen on any other DOOM patch-wads.  Not really a big deal, but it was
kind of a fun idea.

I'd appreciate any and all comments/ flames as to whether it succeeds. It has been beta tested by 2 players other than myself (with a ""thumbs up"" from both), but only in single-player mode. Multi-player and Deathmatch modes are provided, but not tested. The difficulty levels are also implemented. In general, the harder the difficulty, the more monsters you get.

As you make your way to well-earned freedom, you wonder why it seemed so easy to waste the mighty Spiderdemon? Just then, a ghostly apparition appears in the corridor ahead. It is one of your fallen comrades! He speaks to you in a ghostly whisper, but you sense a joy in his haunting voice. He thanks you for rescuing his soul from that monstrous devil. He begins to tell you of his last mission... It seems that of the few space marines who made it to the inferno of Hell, only he had a soul too pure to be corrupted by the teleporter gates. He fought valiantly, but was soon captured-not killed! The hideous Spiderdemon saw a power in that soul he could use for his own. In an unholy ceremony, the Spiderdemon split the marine into two parts--a body and a soul! With the soul in his control, the Spiderdemon would gain even greater power and would be indestructable to any mortal! But, there was one more part to complete the ceremony. The only way for the Spiderdemon to truly possess the soul was to prove that the body was not worthy of it. A test for the human would be the last step of the arcane ritual. The Spiderdemon sent him back to Phobos to a special arena built just for the occasion. If he could fight his way to retrieve his soul, he would be worthy of it. If he failed, the Spiderdemon would become invincible and he would suffer an eternity of torment. If he succeeded, he would be returned to Earth. In the end, he was victorious, but the Spiderdemon broke the rules of the ritual and laid a final trap for him. He was killed and his body taken back to Hell as a trophy. His soul was also brought back and it watched as the Spiderdemon's ritual backfired on him. The monster received a great blast of energy in punishment for his blasphemous actions! The demon was weakened, but very much alive. He unleashed his fury on the only thing he could, the soul of the poor marine! Even though he could never use its power, he was determined to torture the man who cheated him out of immortality. It wasn't until you destroyed the weakened Spiderdemon that he was set free. The spirit turns and begins to float away, but you call out for him to wait. You ask him to tell you more of this final mission.

Steve Phelan,"Additional Notes: ULTIMO is the ultimate DOOM treat - prepare to die ('cause it isn't easy). I designed it as a single player WAD really, but the 'start things' are in for all other modes of play. It takes me about one hour to complete all three levels, with 100% on items, kills and secrets. There is enough ammo for you to complete ALL levels even if you 'warp' straight to them. ULTIMO is named after the new pizza that Pizza Hut introduced whilst I was building the WAD - good knows how many I got through while I was building it. ULTIMO is my first WAD, but if it goes down well I may do some more. Any feedback (bugs, etc.) to the above email address, please.

There are quite a few monsters and enough ammo to get you to the end. My Beta Testers took countless hours to help us to provide a fun and exciting DOOM level. The whole process of developing this level took us about 100 hours to complete. I hope you enjoy playing this level and I very much welcome all comments, good or bad. I can be reach on COMPUSERVE as Todd D. Prince at id number 73131,1037. I will answer all comments and try to implement suggestions.

Kuranes,"The story of this Pwad is as long as the Pwad is big. One day some years ago some friends and I, we discovered that there is a way to create own Pwads. We started to build some at once, and so I started to work on this file; only to try out some ideas, to find out how DEU works and to create something for Deathmatch. So I found out that most of these ideas didn't work, but I found out how DEU works. More ideas came and the Pwad got bigger and bigger and useless for Deathmatch. So I stoped working on it. But I didn't stop building Pwads (stairs.wad, lift.wad, cyrc.wad, ralle.wad) and these Pwads are very good ;-). Now, years later I rediscovered the thos.wad on my HD and made thos02.wad out of it (includes: things, some corrections, an end-level-switch, a demo which shows you how to survive and how to find the big BFG-Secret and some sreenshots). There are still some Bugs (which I see but you might not) and the Pwad is still senseless because DM is only fun with more than 2 players (I never played with more than 2) and because Singleplayer might be to hard. But you should try it out also this one, to be able to compare it to my other Pwads.

Neil Glover,"This wad is an original wad created using DOOMCAD 6.1 It took me about two months to complete in my spare time. When creating it I started with a single room and just kept adding stuff until I was satisfied (check out the throne room!). I designed it to be played as both a single player and multi/death-match player wad (difficulty levels 1-2 for death-match). There are several hidden doors, secret rooms, suprises, and many monsters on higher difficulty settings. I put a lot of attention to detail and haven't found any bugs. The single player mode was tested extensively but I didn't have anyone to test multi or deathmatch modes with. There are a couple of spots where, in death-match you can ambush your buddy (a crushing ceiling in the red room, and a hole in the spine hall where you can pop up out of the floor when he steps across a line).

Eddie Nguyen,"Welcome to SAPIDUS.WAD, the 4th installment in the UCA storyline.
This wad runs under e2m4 and supports single, coop, and deathmatch modes.
It also supports limited difficulty settings (basically intermediate or
ultra-violent).  It was created using DEU5.1, BSP1.0, and a new program
called REJECT1.0.  For the reject, I used a reject value of 512, so if
you need to change it, you have a reference value.  It shouldn't be
necessary, though - SAPIDUS runs quite smoothly on my 486sx-25 at a high
detail, normal-sized screen.  Kudos to the author of REJECT1.0!

SAPIDUS was designed with the assumption that the player is
following the UCA storyline and will consequently play SAPIDUS as the
level right after DIOPATRA (UCA and TALPOIDA are the first two installments).
While SAPIDUS is playable as a stand-alone, but you might find it to be
a major handful that way (after all, this is the main section of the
enemy base, so you will encounter a lot of monsters).  Anyways, I can
complete this wad in about 43 minutes at UV level either as a stand-alone or
within the storyline (keep in mind that while ammo is ample, it is probably
not enough to kill all the monsters if my wad is played as a stand-alone -
you will just have to run from some cacodemons....). Played within the
storyline, it is very possible to get 100% across the scoreboard.",,,"DEU5.1, BSP1.0, and REJECT1.0",,,3.3,6,12,7,1994-06-08,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/340-sapidusb-bugfix-version/?do=download&csrfKey=9ce20ade6413c0dfb220e91c61dd8c2d,Doom,s-u,SAPIDUSB - Bugfix version ,sapidusb.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/sapidusb_SAPIDUSB.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/sapidusb_SAPIDUSB_E2M4.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/sapidusb_SAPIDUSB_E2M4.txt

You will be inserted directly into the base via confiscated enemy slipgate technology and from that point on, you'll be on your own.","id Software for making such nice, friendly games Wad Author WinTex Cakewalk Pro Paintshop Pro Midi2Mus Endoomer",8 new levels from scratch,Wad Author WinTex Cakewalk Pro,key problems in e1m1 (fixed) floating health box in e1m3 (fixed),,3,9,17,10,1997-07-22,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/8273-last-hope-of-the-uac/?do=download&csrfKey=b25091161355c4f416059aaac97f6c77,Doom,v-z,LAST HOPE of the UAC ,zdimhope.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/zdimhope_LASTHOPE.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/zdimhope_LASTHOPE_E1M3.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/zdimhope_LASTHOPE_E1M3.txt
William Benfold,":-< Okay, hows this: It has been noted that some areas of America are more prone to UFO sightings/crashes than anywhere else in the world. However, it is not usual for there to be a confirmed sighting every day in a small village with a population of only a hundred or so. Couple this with the fact that contact with the town has been lost since the local authorities announced that they had captured a handful of extra-terrestrials. It is not known exactly what has happened, the most likely explanations are that either the population of the village has been infected with a fatal disease and are all dead, or that they are under alien control. It has been theorised that in the case of alien control, there must be some form of central command post, which must be infiltrated, investigated, and destroyed as quickly as possible. Due to the nature of this infiltration operation, you will enter the village alone, and with minimal weaponry. You are, however, authorised to use lethal force against any beings of unknown origin, or anyone who attempts to compromise your mission. |\ | \ ________________________| \ | \ | NOW ENTERING THE \ | VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED / |________________________ / | / | / |/",Matt Tagliaferri for DoomCAD Olivier Montanuy for Wintex id software for Doom,New level from scratch,"DoomCAD 6.1, Wintex 4.3",Deep breath....None,,2,4,14,5,1997-07-21,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/8268-village-of-the-damned/?do=download&csrfKey=2584cb2250a0e625087430033fd8612b,Doom,v-z,Village of the Damned ,villaged.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/villaged_Village.wad,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/villaged_Village_E2M1.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/villaged_Village_E2M1.txt

Walter D. Sanz Misc. Editing by Andy R. Olivera,"This level(WSTOWER.WAD) was very well designed, but had an outstanding number of problems. To start with, texture alignment was a major problem. I didn't see one aligned texture. I have aligned most of them. Also, there were many unnecessary sectors, which made the file very large(500K) and slow. I have deleted all such sectors, and, in the process, reduced the file size to 416K. A total of more then 100 sectors were deleted. Speed has also been increased, because of fewer sectors, fewer nodes, and a better reject map. I have made the level much more difficult. There are now a total of 806 monsters, so if you try to save, it will crash. On UV, if you kill all monsters, it takes about 50 minutes. This level is not a sequel to WSTOWER.WAD. It is a revision.

Timothy A. Harris,"Bear with me... I know sometimes I don't care what the story is behind the level - I JUST WANT TO PLAY - but I think you'll be glad you read this first. Zaphod Beeblebrox, our galactic hero and just an all-around great guy, was zipping around in his speedboat on an uncharted watery planet when one of his two heads realized the other knew where he was going. Unfortunately his two heads had previously had a profound disagreement and were not talking to each other. So the uninformed head just had to sit tight (although this gave Zaphod a neck ache) and wait. Soon enough an expansive wall of shimmering blues and reds could be seen closing in from all direc- tions. Despite the circumstances, the informed head remained calm (too calm - a bit trance-like in fact), while the oblivious one remained so. Eventually something could be seen ahead in the distance as the shimmering wall was almost upon him. Soon Zaphod's speedboat came to a splashing halt in front of a large dock. Suddenly his purpose was all too clear! Despite their differences, both heads thought as one (with twice the brain power)! Zaphod had been called to the Land of Ktulu!! There were bits and scraps in in the HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE about such a place - but many thought it was just a myth. But now Zaphod knew they had been mythinformed. Supposedly an unknown being (except it's name) named Ktulu had/has a hunger for humans (specific- ally battle-trained) and ""calls"" them from all over the far reaches of the galaxy to it's land. Apparently Ktulu appreciates a good fight before it overcomes them, but before they are worthy enough to be devoured by Ktulu, they must fight their way through it's minions and find Ktulu's lair! (Zaphod always thought it was just an excuse to soften up the victim). With Zaphod's newly acquired oneness of his two heads, he became acutely aware that his speedboat was sinking. The corrosive waters surrounding Ktulu (the land) work pretty fast, he thought. Luckily his previously only-informed head had gotten Zaphod to wear his neato-cool eLiTE battle armor which would protect him from most corrosive substances - not to mention also bringing the other battle supplies... Zaphod's heads agreed it was a BIG mistake for Ktulu to have called Zaphod Beeblebrox. Zaphod just hoped he could find enough ammunition from fallen predecessors to last through the gauntlet he knew was waiting for him...","-Those visionaries at Id and of course all the ""little visionaries"" (like me) who inspire each other to make better PWADS. -Douglas Adams for Zaphod Beeblebrox and the HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY series. -Metallica for inspiring the music.",New level TOTALLY from scratch,"DEU 5.21, DEU 5.2 GCC, DEUTex 2.9, BSP 1.2, DeHackEd 2.x, RMB 1.x, DmAud 1.1, Midi2Mus","- The most common error is due to Doom's limits: a visplane overflow dropping you to DOS.

In order to give the teleporters a fell of randomness, I split the line def into smaller segments so that crossing at one point might send you to the top of the pyramid.. but it might send you to the prision or to the trench at the base of the pyramid (which also has a teleporter line to the prision) **************************************************** ***I strongly urge you to play with Respawn..There are a few sergeants who can help you if both players wind up in jail..***","ID, Authors of BSP12X, WACKERB7, ICESKY, BITEDUST..

May their programs grow and multiply!,New level from scratch,"DEU 5.1, BSP 1.1x recompiled",There are several places where a single sector is subject to multiple actions. Doom can screw up if you try to do too many things at once. A general rule is to move slowly. Let each stage complete before moving onto the next stage.

CALABRAUN (THE LEY LINE WALKER),"This is definatly the wad I have had the most fun building.  I enjoy playing
it for both deathmatch and single play.  It has some good sniping spots, and
weapon placements.  A couple secrets rooms which arn't hard to find.  Some
really nice scenery I enjoyed making.  If you would like to play the author
at this wad, contact me at the above address, but be warned; you will be
playing on my turf!

Chris Straw,"I created Wedge for my own personal kicks.  The level
is elevator intensive without becoming unplayable.  The level contains all the
gut-splattering and limb severing weapons that DOOM has to offer, though some
are easier to get than others.  Originally designed as a single player game for
people who think that ultra violent is a day at the beach, WEDGE has proved
itself as a KILLER modem deathmatch level.  (This was the consensous after
SEVERAL hours of playtesting, and too many hours for me to mention of fiddling.)",,,DOOMEDIT,,,3.5,12,28,13,1994-05-12,https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/140-wedge/?do=download&csrfKey=9b2bc5fab1efb6fd54f78af5e2f61277,Doom,v-z,Wedge ,wedge.zip,./WADs/Doom/Original/wedge_WEDGE.WAD,./WADs/Doom/Processed - Vectorized/wedge_WEDGE_E1M1.svg,./WADs/Doom/Processed/wedge_WEDGE_E1M1.txt
Mike Barker,"Imagine that a large, abandoned, warehouse in your home town has been overrun by nasties. It is up to you to save the day! You must first fight your way in from outside, make it through the outer offices, and then finally into the warehouse itself. Although difficulty levels are implemented, it is always pretty tough! Good Luck! The level itself is pretty large, and may be a little slow on some machines if all the nasties are running around at the same time.
